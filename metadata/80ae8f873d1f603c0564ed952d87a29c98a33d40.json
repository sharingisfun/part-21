Maximilien Robespierre believed in them passionately. He was an idealist and a lover of humanity. But during the 365 days that Robespierre sat on the Committee of Public Safety, the French Republic descended into a bloodbath. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“The TerrorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ only came to end when Robespierre himself was devoured by the repressive machinery heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d created. This drama-documentary tells the story of the Terror and looks at how RobespierreÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s revolutionary idealism so quickly became an excuse for tyranny, and why a lover of liberty was so keen to use the guillotine.\n\nSimon Schama and Slavoj Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â½iÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¾ek are among the contributors.\nBroadcast 11. July, 2009 20:00 on BBC Two\n\nFor more videos on Slavoj Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â½iÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¾ek check out my blog:\nmariborchan.wordpress .com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80ae8f873d1f603c0564ed952d87a29c98a33d40","amp;dn":"BBC+Two+-+Terror%21+Robespierre+and+the+French+Revolution","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80ae8f873d1f603c0564ed952d87a29c98a33d40","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,174,143,135,61,31,96,60,5,100,237,149,45,135,162,156,152,163,61,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
