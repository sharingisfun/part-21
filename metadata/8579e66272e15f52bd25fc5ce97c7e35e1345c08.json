During a heist of some sort. Why not in a more controlled environment, you wonder? I don't have an answer, but it may just be a case of the sentiment expressed in the lede quote.\n\nThe issue number in the title may be a bit premature in this case, as I don't actually know that there'll ever be an issue 1, but considering that the story isn't just open-ended but also open-middled and open-beginninged, there really ought to. :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8579e66272e15f52bd25fc5ce97c7e35e1345c08","amp;dn":"Blackout+0+%28from+DHP+24-26%7C2013%7CDgtl-1680%7CSon+of+Ultron-Empire%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8579e66272e15f52bd25fc5ce97c7e35e1345c08","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,121,230,98,114,225,95,82,189,37,252,92,233,124,126,53,225,52,92,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
