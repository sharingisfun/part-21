It was posted initially on a small forum and now you can hear it here. Well, more exactly, this is a slightly different version, in which track 11 - &quot;Opium&quot; by Jute - was replaced by another Jute song, due to the fact that the mix can't have two climaxes, one after another (thanks to &quot;Flooded&quot;, it is already dizzy enough). Also, the first track - &quot;Dancing On the Moon Within My Shoes&quot; by Lost Balance - was replaced by another Lost Balance track, &quot;Tunefull&quot;, which, in my opinion, stands better as a first track...\nIn the meantime, I have done lots of other compilations where you can also hear some of these songs, so forgive me if you've been watching my comps for a while... (I would like though to make soon a volume from Caferino Albuquerque with enough songs from artists I haven't featured before)\n\nHappy New Year!\n\nTracklisting:\n1.
