Whatever America IS, this is what the founders INTENDED it to be. This is critical information that should be read and understood by every American. Consider it the driver's manual to the US Constitution.\n\nThe ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFCLÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Series ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ For some length of time now, IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve given some thought to putting out something like this. A principal problem is that of labels, and another is the lack of room in a torrent description to write anything approaching even a SYNOPSIS of a clear manifesto. Therefore, I have decided to call this FCL (an acronym for Fiscal Conservative Libertarian) for the sake of brevity and clarity.\n\nThere are in America (and to a lesser degree in Europe) a huge number of people who would largely fit into this camp. We are the practical, the scientific, the skeptical and the truly logically analytical. We are IN NO WAY dogmatic or organized, but we generically agree to a certain extent on some core ideas. We think people who attend rallies or protests are shmucks. We think people can express their political opinions on bumperstickers are too stupid to vote. We think whenever we hear the phrase ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œthere ought to be a law!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ that there probably shouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t be. We have differing opinions on abortion, gun control, the death penalty, flag burning, and gay rights, but agree categorically that such decisions ought not to be Constitutional issues and are best left to the local voters. We think that the Federal Government ought not to do much of anything other than core responsibilities, especially if they have no idea how to pay for it. We donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t vote with out hearts but with our heads. We are never loyal to any party. We are very pro-military, and most of us have served. We donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t trust any politician and we despise empty symbolism, ignorant populism, and idiotic sloganeering. We are all about practical economics, actual freedom from the leftist nannies and rightist religious police, and we like individual responsibility.\n\nPeople like me have been going nuts for a long time with the economic stupidities of our government and fellow citizens, the general inability of these to understand real long term effects, and we are sick to death of people blaming US for George Bush instead of the RELIGIOUS and SOCIAL conservatives who elected him. We are NOT ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œneo-consÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œdittoheadsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, or lovers of Fox News, and we are sick and tired of lefties telling us we must be supporters of Limbaugh and Falwell. WE are the people who watch Penn &amp; TellerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s BULLSHIT and love SOUTH PARK. We think Obama is a very nice fellow whose economic policies at best will lead America on a path in the long run to a low rent failed soft-core Socialism. Finally, we think that the 40% on either side that make up the core of the two major sides are usually reaching bad conclusions and voting stupidly because they listen to propaganda and donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t truly understand some complicated issues with an honest degree of depth.\n\nTherefore, since there is no shortage of people here with an agenda (some of which borders on the insane), I am going to put out a collection of material that gives a good accounting of the fiscal conservative point of view. Some of it I personally take as gospel, some of it is merely generic. Speaking as a history and social studies teacher, I feel qualified to select materials that reflect this point of view. It is my hope that many will increase their knowledge of complicated historical and economic events by this effort. I do not seek to foster argument or win converts, but merely to explain to the right wingers why we would rather have freedom than ban abortion or marijuana, and to get it through to the left that not everyone who doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t toe their fantasy line is a flat-Earther or fascist. Most of this material will be conservative, and most will deal with economics. There will be no political diatribes from dogmatic and non-practical people (Sorry to all the Coulter and Chomsky fans) who are more intent on pushing a fantasy utopia that pursuing practical liberty.\n\nRambam1776 &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://federali.st/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://federali.st/&lt;/a&gt; - Searchable text version &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federalist_papers&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federalist_papers&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe Federalist Papers are a series of 85 articles advocating the ratification of the United States Constitution. Seventy-seven of the essays were published serially in The Independent Journal and The New York Packet between October 1787 and August 1788. A compilation of these and eight others, called The Federalist, was published in 1788 by J. and A. McLean.[1]\n\nThe Federalist Papers serve as a primary source for interpretation of the Constitution, as they outline the philosophy and motivation of the proposed system of government.[2] The authors of the Federalist Papers wanted both to influence the vote in favor of ratification and to shape future interpretations of the Constitution. According to historian Richard B. Morris, they are an &quot;incomparable exposition of the Constitution, a classic in political science unsurpassed in both breadth and depth by the product of any later American writer.&quot;[3]\n\nThe articles were written by:\n\n    * Alexander Hamilton (51 articles: nos. 1, 6ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“9, 11ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“13, 15ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“17, 21ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“36, 59ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“61, and 65ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“85)\n    * James Madison (29 articles: nos. 10, 14, 18ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“20, 37ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“58, and 62ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“63), and\n    * John Jay (5 articles: 2ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“5 and 64).[1]\n\nThey appeared under the pseudonym &quot;Publius,&quot; in honor of Roman consul Publius Valerius Publicola.[4] Madison is generally credited as the father of the Constitution and became the fourth President of the United States.[5] Hamilton was an active delegate at the Constitutional Convention, and became the first Secretary of the Treasury. John Jay became the first Chief Justice of the United States.\n\nFederalist No. 10, which discusses the means of preventing faction and advocates for a large republic (and warns of the dangers of a democracy), is generally regarded as the most important of the 85 articles from a philosophical perspective.[6] Federalist No. 84 is also notable for its opposition to a Bill of Rights. Federalist No. 78 is another important one, laying down groundwork that would eventually become judicial review. Federalist No. 51 may be the clearest exposition of what has come to be called &quot;Federalism.&quot;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0562d13d9a24a1fa274788ffcba6bda3b4e835ee","amp;dn":"FCL+Series+-++The+Federalist+Papers+%2F+US+Constitution+explained","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0562d13d9a24a1fa274788ffcba6bda3b4e835ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,98,209,61,154,36,161,250,39,71,136,255,203,166,189,163,180,232,53,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
