A down-and-out writer tries to keep his dignity at all costs.\nStunning photography, performances and screenwriting.\nThe actors, as well as the dialog, are assembled from Norway, Sweden and Denmark. Imagine that that might be an exaggeration of the times related in the book.  Norway, then a part of Sweden, had long perpetuated its cultural connection with Denmark after being &quot;gifted&quot; to Sweden. Somehow it all works, and the result is near perfect.\n\nIn Black and White...\nWith English and French Subtitles... (there is a PAL version with quite a variety)\nWith an interview with the director...\nWith a conversation with Paul Auster and Regina Hamsun...\n\nUncompressed NTSC VIDEO_TS files\n\nWhen was the last time you discovered something new and nutritious?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a71f9dfc7cfa2297cc5150f20c8eb12dadb0d26d","amp;dn":"Henning+Carlsen%2FKnut+Hamsun+-+Hunger%2FSult+-+1966","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a71f9dfc7cfa2297cc5150f20c8eb12dadb0d26d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,31,157,252,124,250,34,151,204,81,80,242,12,142,177,45,173,176,210,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
