However, the events of 100 years ago are about to come back to haunt the town, because a conspiracy of the town's founders resulted in the deaths of several lepers in a shipwreck. The conspirators had planned to lure the lepers' ship towards the rocks so that it would sink, and they could recover the cargo of gold and use it to pay for building the town. The sinister plot succeeded when a fog rolled in, blinding the crew, and forcing them to follow the false fire on shore. Now the ghosts of the Elizabeth Dane's crew are back - and so is the fog that led them to their doom. Only now, it conceals and protects the ghosts of the crew, as they seek their revenge on the residents of Antonio Bay...\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b137393d6f5f7831b66a51f2c3ca267c8775992","amp;dn":"The+Fog+%281980%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b137393d6f5f7831b66a51f2c3ca267c8775992","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,19,115,147,214,245,247,131,27,102,165,31,44,60,162,103,200,119,89,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
