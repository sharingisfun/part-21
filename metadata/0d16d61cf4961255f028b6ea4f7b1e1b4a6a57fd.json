Oliver; The Jewish Strategy. How the Jews have survived thousands of years of persecution - and why we of the West may not survive this century. Dr. Revilo Pendleton Oliver, Professor of the Classics at the University of Illinois for thirty two years, was a scholar of international distinction who wrote scholarly articles in four languages, which were published in twelve learned periodicals of the United States and Europe. From the book: &quot;Passionate hatred of the Jews is almost certain to be futile, for violent emotions prevent rational thought.... The international race... by arduous, intelligent, and indefatigable work for more than twenty-five centuries, has, through its own efforts, made itself the major world power today.... History provides no parallel for that stupendous accomplishment. It must be regarded with respect, even awe.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d16d61cf4961255f028b6ea4f7b1e1b4a6a57fd","amp;dn":"The+Jewirategy%3A+How+the+Jews+Have+Survived+Thousands+of+Years+of","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d16d61cf4961255f028b6ea4f7b1e1b4a6a57fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,22,214,28,244,150,18,85,240,40,182,234,79,123,30,27,74,106,87,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
