It consists of fourteen chapters written by individuals who have been inspired by his work and have followed in his footsteps by refining our knowledge of this field and opening new research directions. In Professor Hutzingerâ€™s tradition of passing on valuable information to others, the authors present recent advances in areas such as inventories, remediation, and analytical determinations. Levels and trends in abiotic environments, biota, and human exposure via food, as well as the risks to the environment and humans from polychlorinated dibenzo dioxins, furans, and PCBs are also discussed. Other chapters deal with the relevant topics of DDT and its metabolites along with halogenated and phosphorus flame retardants","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:064cefd52f345a0d689d460c3d8158d48dcb777a","amp;dn":"Dioxin+and+Related+Compounds+-+Mehran+Alaee","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"064cefd52f345a0d689d460c3d8158d48dcb777a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,76,239,213,47,52,90,13,104,157,70,12,61,129,88,212,141,203,119,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
