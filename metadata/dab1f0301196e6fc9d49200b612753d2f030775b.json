Hell In The Hills (6:20)\n\nTimbercreek, a young band of ruffians who hailed from the small town of Boulder Creek (pop. 4081), nestled deep in the Santa Cruz Mountains of Northern California, recorded this lost country-rock gem with a for-real-not-ironic-rural-vibe in 1975. The small California indie label Renegade Records released the lp, and depending on whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s story you choose to believe, somewhere between 100 and 3,000 copies of Hellbound Highway were pressed. Needless to say, this record is very rare, and very, very good. If youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re a fan of The Flying Burrito Brothers, The Band, The New Riders of the Purple Sage, or WorkingmanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Dead/American Beauty era Grateful Dead then today is your lucky day.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dab1f0301196e6fc9d49200b612753d2f030775b","amp;dn":"Timbercreek...+Hellbound+Highway%281975%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dab1f0301196e6fc9d49200b612753d2f030775b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,177,240,48,17,150,230,252,157,73,32,11,97,39,83,210,240,48,119,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
