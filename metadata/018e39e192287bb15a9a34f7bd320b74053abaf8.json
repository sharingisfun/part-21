They didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t steal cars, commit armed robberies, or burn down someoneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s house. Their trouble was different. It was more creative. It still landed them in handcuffs, on the evening news, and for Mark, ultimately getting kicked out of high school making him the talk of his small Wisconsin town. This is a memoir of his wild childhood, his crazy college life, and his adventures in California after he and his friends packed up and headed west in search of their dreams when they were 20-years-old.\n\nSome of MarkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Trouble Included:\n\nPainting obscenities consisting of 30-foot tall letters in the snow on the school football field using food coloring mixed with water in a giant weed sprayer, sending hundreds of magazine subscriptions to a teacher and checking the Ã¢â‚¬Å“bill me laterÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ box, replacing the magazines in the school library with pornos, sending a fake college rejection letter to a former friend informing them that the school had changed its mind about enrolling him, police chases, making fake IDs, prank phone calls, joy riding, shoe tossing, running for class president, making crop circles, scamming monthsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ worth of free food, stealing cable TV, printing fake vehicle registration tags, going to jail, and thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just the beginning!\n\nAfter many legal troubles and personal tragedy, Mark was luckily able to manage his unbridled creativity and focus it constructively. His writings on politics, spirituality, and pop culture have enlightened countless people causing them to look closely at their own life and the road that theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re on and where it will ultimately lead them. \n\nAbout the author:\nMark Dice is a media analyst, social critic, political activist, and author who, in an entertaining and educational way, gets people to question our celebrity obsessed culture, and the role the mainstream media plays in shaping our lives. Mark frequently stirs up controversy from his commentaries, protests, and boycotts, and has repeatedly been featured in major media outlets around the world. Several of Mark's YouTube videos have went viral, earning him a mention on ABC's The View, Fox News' O'Reilly Factor, TMZ.com, and other mainstream media outlets. Mark has also been featured in (or attacked in) the New York Post's Page Six, Rolling Stone Magazine, USA Today, The New York Daily News, and in major papers in Pakistan and Iran.\n\nMark Dice appears in several documentary films including Invisible Empire, and The 9/11 Chronicles, and was featured on the History Channel's Decoded. He enjoys enlightening zombies, as he calls them, (ignorant people) about the mass media's effect on our culture, pointing out Big Brother's prying eyes, and exposing elite secret societies along with scumbag politicians and their corrupt political agendas.\n\nHe also habitually calls into several top-rated talk shows, including the Sean Hannity Show, Glenn Beck, and Michael Savage, and verbally battles with the hosts on various issues since he has never been asked to be a guest on them as of yet. Audio of some of these calls are then posted online. The term &quot;fighting the New World Order&quot; is used by Mark to describe some of his activities, and refers to his and others' resistance and opposition (The Resistance) to the overall system of political corruption, illegal wars, elite secret societies, mainstream media, Big Brother and privacy issues; as well as various economic and social issues.\n\nDice and his supporters sometimes refer to being &quot;awake&quot; or &quot;enlightened&quot; and see their knowledge of these topics as part of their own personal Resistance to the corrupt New World Order. This Resistance involves self-improvement, self-sufficiency, personal responsibility and spiritual growth. Mark Dice is the author of several books on current events, secret societies and conspiracies. He lives in San Diego, California","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:018e39e192287bb15a9a34f7bd320b74053abaf8","amp;dn":"Causing+Trouble+-+Mark+Dice","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"018e39e192287bb15a9a34f7bd320b74053abaf8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,142,57,225,146,40,123,177,90,154,52,247,189,50,11,116,5,58,186,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
