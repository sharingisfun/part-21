Shine On\n\nIndie bluegrass band Son Volt emerged from the ruins of Uncle Tupelo, so I was thrilled when their new album Honky Tonk came across my desk. Upon putting it in my car stereo, I was immediately greeted by the cheerfully upbeat opener Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hearts and MindsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ whose lyrics speak of Ã¢â‚¬Å“looking for love outside of dangerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ over a sunny, Cajun-like waltz. The rest of the album is a far more somber affair, with a typical country sound that is constantly being subverted by odd turns of poetic phrase in the lyrics. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Brick WallsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ speaks of a relationship where Ã¢â‚¬Å“thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more brick walls than bridges on the way to your heartÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, and even Ã¢â‚¬Å“Wild SideÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, a tribute to a gracious rebel reminds us that Ã¢â‚¬Å“weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll all be tested anyway.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“BakersfieldÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ seems to be more about a location in the soul than a location on the map, and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Angel of the BluesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ offers an ever-so-slightly more modern sound, which isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t the blues per se but has quite the melancholy mood. Ã¢â‚¬Å“SeawallÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ seemingly carries forward the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s underlying theme of divisions and barriers that was first introduced in Ã¢â‚¬Å“Brick WallsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and is also referred to in Ã¢â‚¬Å“Barricades.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Honky Tonk is an album firmly planted at the intersection of bluegrass, folk and Americana, a beautiful juxtaposition of traditional music with exquisite poetry.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b00e3bb78eaef76ced93d1e52c1712a1da38566","amp;dn":"Son+Volt+-+Honky+Tonk+%5B2013%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b00e3bb78eaef76ced93d1e52c1712a1da38566","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,0,227,187,120,234,239,118,206,217,61,30,82,193,113,42,29,163,133,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
