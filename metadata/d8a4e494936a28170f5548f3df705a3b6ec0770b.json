By the early '90s, this jazz-rap-funk fusion had become hip and profitable, which led Blue Note to assemble the Blue Break Beats compilations. \nAll of the tracks on the two discs are from late '60s and early '70s albums, featuring multi-layered percussion, organs, and guitars. Every song on the two discs -- which are sold separately -- is hot, with a deep funky groove, and there are no dull spots on the albums. \nThough it's designed to appeal to fans of contemporary funk and rap, fans of rock-influenced soul-jazz will find Blue Break Beats a necessary purchase.
