A cosmetic surgeon takes pride in his best work - an ingenue of the silver screen literally built for success. While he works to convince her that one more surgery will perfect her looks, his aging wife struggles to keep his interest, and his ambitious assistant moves to usurp his practice. Acclaimed mini-comic creator Will Dinski presents a haunting, pastel vision of beauty and decay in Fingerprints, his full-color debut graphic novel.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f55e04b7b8209ca5ff4ab4d17c930ec07d65ce8","amp;dn":"Will+Dinski%3A+Fingerprints+%28Top+Shelf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f55e04b7b8209ca5ff4ab4d17c930ec07d65ce8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,85,224,75,123,130,9,202,95,244,171,77,23,201,48,236,7,214,92,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
