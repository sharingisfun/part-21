Through real-world case studies and worked examples, students will develop and apply basic operations through to advanced concepts, covering a wide range of biophysical topics including chemical kinetics and thermodynamics, transport phenomena, and cellular electrophysiology. Each chapter is built around case studies in a given application area, with simulations of real biological systems developed to analyze and interpret data. Open-ended project-based exercises are provided at the end of each chapter, and with all data and computer codes available online (www.cambridge.org/biosim) students can quickly and easily run, manipulate, explore and expand on the examples inside. This hands-on guide is ideal for use on senior undergraduate/graduate courses and also as a self-study guide for anyone who needs to develop computational models of biological systems.\n\nProvides hands-on experience for devising, designing and analyzing simulations of biophysics processes\nDevelops through real-world case studies and practical worked examples\nAll computer codes for the examples in the book are provided online so students can use the example codes as a starting point to develop their own applications\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://virtualrat.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/dans_book.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://virtualrat.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/dans_book.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nabout author :\n\nDaniel A. Beard, Medical College of Wisconsin\nDaniel A. Beard is a Professor in the Biotechnology and Bioengineering Center and the Department of Physiology at the Medical College of Wisconsin. Research in his laboratory is focused on systems engineering approaches to understanding the operation of physiological systems in health and disease. A recent major effort in his group has been on theoretical and experimental characterization of the thermodynamics, kinetics and electrophysiology of cardiac mitochondria. Additional research interests include non-equilibrium thermodynamics in biochemical networks, mass transport and microvascular exchange in physiological systems, and drug metabolism and physiologically-based pharmacokinetics.\n\n\n`~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\n  SEED PLEASE , LET OTHERS GET IT TOO. \n `~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:83261e2da427feb875426174b5b02dde8686d4cb","amp;dn":"Biosimulation+Simulation+of+Living+Systems+prabhu_","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"83261e2da427feb875426174b5b02dde8686d4cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,38,30,45,164,39,254,184,117,66,97,116,181,176,45,222,134,134,212,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
