This new series offers the most comprehensive views of key areas in the world of science. Each set explores all facets of the topic, offering not only descriptive and analytical information, but also cultural and ethical issues, and career opportunities in many fields of science.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c6f6fc973b24feeaf47c2f3011d2624fc6c08f4","amp;dn":"Biology%3A+Macmillan+Science+Library+%284+Volume+Set%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c6f6fc973b24feeaf47c2f3011d2624fc6c08f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,111,111,201,115,178,79,238,175,71,194,243,1,29,38,36,252,108,8,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
