R. Searl (1993) which presents the history of John R. R. Searl&amp;#039;s breathtaking electrogravitic flying discs. In 1968 Professor John Searl designed, built and remotely flew over 20 different &quot;Levity Disks&quot; as he called them. The design came from dreams he had as a boy with largest being over 30ft in diameter. The heart of his design is the SEG (Searl Effect Generator) which produces far more power out than in and is perpetual and runs cold in contrast to ordinary generators which heat up dramatically while operating. This fascinating book details his life and the giant effort he and his collagues made to advance this technology of the future. Contains many rare photos of Searl&amp;#039;s saucers while they were actually in flight. Find out the story behind one of the most amazing pioneers behind manmade saucers. 130 pages, many pictures. A must read from everyone.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b456c66e5731303f959512ed222b2e7116767f2c","amp;dn":"Thomas-Antigravity-Dream+Made+Reality%281993%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b456c66e5731303f959512ed222b2e7116767f2c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,86,198,110,87,49,48,63,149,149,18,237,34,43,46,113,22,118,127,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
