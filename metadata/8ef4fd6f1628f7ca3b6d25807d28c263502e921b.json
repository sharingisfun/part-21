Does logic require dualisms? Can logic reconcile opposed ways of understanding the world? And when things are divided, does the boundary have a logic? The author begins the exploration of these questions with a discussion of the process of analyzing and constructing arguments. Using the logical theories of C. S. Peirce, John Dewey, and Josiah Royce to frame the investigation, subsequent chapters outline the process of inquiry, the concept of communicative action, the nature of validity, categorical reasoning through the theory of the syllogism, and inductive reasoning and probability. The book concludes with a presentation of modal logic, propositional logic, and quantification.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ef4fd6f1628f7ca3b6d25807d28c263502e921b","amp;dn":"Logic%3A+Inquiry%2C+Argument%2C+and+Order+%282010%29+pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ef4fd6f1628f7ca3b6d25807d28c263502e921b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,244,253,111,22,40,247,202,59,109,37,128,125,40,194,99,80,46,146,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
