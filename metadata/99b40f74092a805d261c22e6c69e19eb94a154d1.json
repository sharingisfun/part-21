When the band formed they were originally known as The Queerboys and later as the London Quireboys in the United States, settling at last with their current name.\n\nThe band were successful during the late 1980s and early 1990s, with their debut album A Bit of What You Fancy reaching No. 2 on the UK charts. Their highest charting single for the band was with the song &quot;Hey You&quot;, which reached No. 14.\n\nIn 1993, the Quireboys broke up but briefly reformed live in 1995 with different members. A more permanent reformation came in 2001 when frontman Spike, guitarist Guy Griffin and bassist Nigel Mogg put together a new line-up. The band is still active, recording new material and playing live.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBitter Sweet &amp; Twisted is rock band The Quireboys's second studio album, released in 1993. The album was released on EMI and went into the UK Albums Chart at #31.\n\nThree of the tracks from this album (&quot;Tramps &amp; Thieves&quot;, &quot;Brother Louie&quot; and &quot;Last Time&quot;) were released as singles, the latter of which was only released in Japan. &quot;Brother Louie&quot; was the highest charting from this album, as it reached #32 on the UK Singles Chart.\n\nThe album was produced mostly by Bob Rock, some of the tracks were produced by The Rolling Stones producer Chris Kimsey. After this album, The Quireboys would split up and didn't release another studio album until 2001.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:99b40f74092a805d261c22e6c69e19eb94a154d1","amp;dn":"The+Quireboys+-+Bitter+Sweet+And+Twisted+%5B1993%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"99b40f74092a805d261c22e6c69e19eb94a154d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,180,15,116,9,42,128,93,38,28,34,230,198,158,25,235,148,161,84,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
