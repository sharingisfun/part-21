But she is a Howard, and therefore ambitious, so she assumes the role Henry VIII has assigned her-his untouched child bride, his adored fifth wife. \n\nBut her innocence is imagined, the first of many lies she will have to tell to gain the throne. And the path that she will tread to do so is one fraught with the same dangers that cost Queen Anne her head.\n\nGenre: Fiction/Historical","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81db7a2c35203ec3b15679d4ded4499666adf9ef","amp;dn":"No+Will+But+His+by+Sarah+A.+Hoyt","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81db7a2c35203ec3b15679d4ded4499666adf9ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,219,122,44,53,32,62,195,177,86,121,212,222,212,73,150,102,173,249,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
