The trio's approach is similar to that of the more famous Tamba Trio Ã¢â‚¬â€œ in that the three members groove on keyboards, bass, and percussion Ã¢â‚¬â€œ while also harmonizing vocals in a soaring, airy style that really adds a lot to the set. This album's got the group using a bit of organ and electric piano in addition to their usual acoustic keys Ã¢â‚¬â€œ making for a bossa style that's slightly electrified, with great results on the album's overall sound. The set includes a really great uptempo version of &quot;Aguas De Marco&quot;, plus the tracks &quot;Alo Feveiro&quot;, &quot;Quem Vem La&quot;, &quot;Cavaleiro De Aruanda&quot;, &quot;Sandalia De Prata&quot;, &quot;Bate Barriga&quot;, &quot;Feitinha P'Ro Poeta&quot;, and &quot;Duas Contas&quot;.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:058ccb6f3d87cf90a04bb54af9e7d10247944b67","amp;dn":"Jongo+Trio+-+Same+%281972%29+MP3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"058ccb6f3d87cf90a04bb54af9e7d10247944b67","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,140,203,111,61,135,207,144,160,75,181,74,249,231,209,2,71,148,75,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
