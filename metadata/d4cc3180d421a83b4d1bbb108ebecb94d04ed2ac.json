She is being controlled by a corrupt cop who gives her targets to kill, detailing to her the crimes these men have committed in order to justify their death. Some of his power over Sawa has to do with her deceased parents and the promise of revenge. When another orphan, a teenage boy called Oburi, is brought in to assist Sawa, the two teenage killers form a bond of sorts. As they heal each other's emotional wounds, they begin to dream of a life that would not be spent under the shadows of murder.   \n\nThe &quot;Director's Cut&quot; version contains previously unreleased footage, namely sex scenes. These scenes may not be to your taste, but contain some flashbacks and plot info that is missing in the edited version. A few brief flashback scenes featuring 'young Sawa' are still cut from this version. \n\nI am a fan of this movie, and was unsatisfied of the quality of the rips available. I had problems with the subtitles on the dvd, which may explain some of the copies available without subs. I downloaded and modified a .srt from hshare and encoded from my Director's Cut dvd as a 'high' quality H264/AAC .mp4 for cross platform compatibility, (too big for iPod tho, *shrug)  with .ass subs and dual language tracks.\n\nPeace and Love,\n\nhms-one","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4cc3180d421a83b4d1bbb108ebecb94d04ed2ac","amp;dn":"%7Chms-one%7C+Kite+-+Director%5C%27s+Cut.mp4+%28jp%2Fen+audio%2C+en+sub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d4cc3180d421a83b4d1bbb108ebecb94d04ed2ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,204,49,128,212,33,168,59,77,27,187,16,142,190,203,148,208,78,210,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
