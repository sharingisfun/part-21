If this comes as a surprise, welcome to the cutting edge of modern biblical scholarship. According to Helms, the gospels were written to convert or confirm their highly colored arguments of powerful authors, not just transparent windows upon the historical Jesus. If we adjust our focus from the brilliant imaginative pictures to the imaginations that produced them, to the situations out of which they arose, we get to the point of this book - a study of the minds of the authors.\r\n\r\nDr. Randel Helms, a professor at Arizona State University in Tempe, teaches courses in Bible as Literature, World Literature, and 19th Century Romantic Literature. He is the author of the highly-acclaimed and controversial book, Gospel Fictions, that now has over 150,000 copies in print.\r\n\r\nThis PDF is not available for purchase anywhere. I had it made for myself, and to share with the world.
