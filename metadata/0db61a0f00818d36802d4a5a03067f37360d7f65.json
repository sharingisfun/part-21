(4:00)\n\n&quot;Australian musician (and oh, so much more) Clare Bowditch has turned her sharp mind to the pursuit of happiness for her fifth and most recent album, The Winter I Chose Happiness.\nDedicating two years of her life to the investigation of what makes us happy, Clare's research has seen her dabble with the concept that eating raw-food can make us happy, and a term known as neuro-plasticity - an area of brain science that suggests we can change our behaviour through changing our thoughts.\nProduced by herself, and husband and band mate Marty Brown at their home-made recording studio, Standalone Studios in Coburg, Victoria, the record's theme was born from a collaboration Clare had with Wally de Backer, aka Gotye on one of the album's track, Are You Ready?.\nFeaturing a band that includes Tim Harvey on guitar, and Clare's Lady Garden chorus of female backing vocalists, The Winter I Chose Happiness is Clare Bowditch at her most personal, mining the depths of happiness, and sorrow for her art.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0db61a0f00818d36802d4a5a03067f37360d7f65","amp;dn":"Clare+Bowditch+-+The+Winter+I+Chose+Happiness+%5B2012%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0db61a0f00818d36802d4a5a03067f37360d7f65","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,182,26,15,0,129,141,54,128,45,74,90,3,6,127,55,54,13,127,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
