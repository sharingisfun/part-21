The group's membership has had at least a dozen changes over the years, including a period from 1976 to 1981 when the band performed and recorded as The Dirt Band. Constant members since the early times are singer-guitarist Jeff Hanna and drummer Jimmie Fadden. Guitarist-vocalist Jackson Browne was in the first line-up. Multi-instrumentalist John McEuen was with the band from 1966 to 1986 and returned during 2001. Keyboardist Bob Carpenter joined the band in 1977. The band is often cited as instrumental to the progression of contemporary country and roots music.\nIn 1977 the Dirt Band was the first American group allowed by the Soviet Union to tour Russia, playing concerts and a televised appearance that is estimated to have been watched by 145 million people.\nHomepage:    &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.nittygritty.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.nittygritty.com/&lt;/a&gt;\nDiscography: &lt;a href=&quot; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitty_Gritty_Dirt_Band_discography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitty_Gritty_Dirt_Band_discography&lt;/a&gt;\n[From Wikipedia]\n\nCheck the INFO file for more details about this torrent\nand....\ndon't make me plead, please seed!\n\n- THOUGHT FOR THE DAY\nMy psychiatrist told me I was crazy and I said I want a second opinion.
