The adventures or misadventures of the Warner Brothers, Yakko and Wakko, and the Warner Sister, Dot, who were so crazy that the studio execs locked them away in the water town at the Studio. The witty, slapstick humor with pop culture parodies and cartoon wackiness is on DVD for the first time ever with 25 fantastic Animaniacs episodes.\n\nAnimaniacsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Volume 2 picks up where the first volume let off, almost literally. Instead of simply picking and choosing the best episodes to put in each volume, the series is being put out sequentially. It actually makes more sense to release the shows in volumes like this instead of seasons, since cartoon series seasons can be erratic in length. Comparing the set to an episode list shows one or to episodes were skipped over, but otherwise this is a good continuation of the series.\n\nThe set contains 25 episodes spread over five discs. Among the better segments are some of the creative, almost educational songs (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Senses Song,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPlanets SongÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½), the meeting of Dracula and the Warner Brothers (and the Warner Sister), and one of those rare instances where someone out-Warner the Warners (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSurvey LadiesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½). Each disc gives you the option to watch all of the episodes without stopping or to jump to specific segments within an episode.\npisodes include\n\ndisc 1\n1-Babblin Bajou\n2-You Risk Your Life\n3-Good Idea-Bad Idea\n4-Draculee-Draculaa\n5-Hot-Bothered And Bedevelled\n\ndisc 2\n1-Mime Time\n2-Chairman Of The Bored\n3-Noah`s Ark\n4-Clown And Out\n5-In The Garden Of Mindy\n\ndisc 3\n1-critical condition\n2-dough dough boys\n3-spell bound\n\n\nplus lots more\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53d9147450d95bebee16b2c19187e95b30a6addd","amp;dn":"Animaniacs-dvd+Collection-Volume+2%5Bxvids%5Dby+The_Stig%40T.F.RG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53d9147450d95bebee16b2c19187e95b30a6addd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,217,20,116,80,217,91,235,238,22,178,193,145,135,233,91,48,166,173,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
