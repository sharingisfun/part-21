Drawing on their theoretical perspectives, the authors provide a comparative analysis of the various schools working in activity theory and a new approach to the study of human work derived from applied and systemic-structural activity theory. They cover special topics such as functional analysis of attention and classification of professions developed utilizing applied activity theory methods. In addition the book presents comparative analysis of work activity theory and applications.\nRepresenting the next significant step in the development of applied and systemic-structural activity theory, the book offers a balanced picture of theoretical and applied issues in the study of human work from general, applied, and systemic-structural activity theory points of view. It provides state-of-the art information and emphasizes its application to the study of human work while interacting with advanced technology.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9b6c25d7c2e4b075bebaef0617c9844e2185c64","amp;dn":"Human-Computer+Interaction+and+Operators%27+Performance","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9b6c25d7c2e4b075bebaef0617c9844e2185c64","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,182,194,93,124,46,75,7,91,235,174,240,97,124,152,68,226,24,92,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
