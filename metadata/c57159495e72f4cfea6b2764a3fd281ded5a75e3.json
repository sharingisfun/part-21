Berlin et al. (AAP, 2016).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 978-1-4987-2859-1\r\n\r\nAdditives are selected depending on the type of polymers to which they will be added or the application for which they will be used. The appropriate selection of additives helps develop value-added plastics with improved durability as well as other advantages. This research book provides a range of modern techniques and new research on the use of additives in a variety of applications. The methods and instrumentation described represent modern analytical techniques useful to researchers, product development specialists, and quality control experts in polymer synthesis and manufacturing. Engineers, polymer scientists, and technicians will find this volume useful in selecting approaches and techniques applicable to characterizing molecular, compositional, rheological, and thermodynamic properties of elastomers and plastics.\r\n\r\nThe informative chapters are the work of researchers at the Department of Polymers and Composite Materials at the prestigious Semenov Institute of Chemical Physics of Russian Academy of Sciences","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c57159495e72f4cfea6b2764a3fd281ded5a75e3","amp;dn":"Additives+in+Polymers+-+Analysis+and+Applications","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c57159495e72f4cfea6b2764a3fd281ded5a75e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,113,89,73,94,114,244,207,234,107,39,100,163,253,40,29,237,90,117,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
