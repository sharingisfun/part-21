I had never posted them before as you are aware an extended play (EP) is a vinyl record or CD which contains more music than a single, but is too short to qualify as an LP. Usually, an EP has around 10ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“28 minutes of music, for this reason they never made it to 4 rare 80s albums series. Here's the obscure record by Screaming For Emily, released in 1987.
