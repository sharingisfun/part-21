This is the well-written story of several Scottish families during the short peace time when Napoleon was exiled to the Island of Elba, and what happens when Bonaparte escapes, setting out on his next campaign. Drama, Mystery, Comedy, Tragedy, and an enlightened look at the horrors of war and the last battle of Waterloo are contained in this tale.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7550d0801a7b2c72cd2daea7d8502a3a78dfd46a","amp;dn":"The+Great+Shadow+and+Other+Napoleonic+Tales+by+Arthur+Conan+Doyl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7550d0801a7b2c72cd2daea7d8502a3a78dfd46a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,80,208,128,26,123,44,114,205,45,174,167,216,80,42,58,120,223,212,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
