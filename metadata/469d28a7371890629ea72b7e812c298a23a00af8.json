The two main sections cover applied or engineering kinetics, reactor analysis and design. Includes updated coverage of computer modeling methods and many new worked examples. Most of the examples use real kinetic data from processes of industrial importance.\n\n\n\n# Hardcover: 860 pages\n# Publisher: Wiley; 3 edition (August 16, 2010)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0470565411\n# ISBN-13: 978-0470565414","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:469d28a7371890629ea72b7e812c298a23a00af8","amp;dn":"Chemical+Reactor+Analysis+and+Design%2C3rd+Edition%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"469d28a7371890629ea72b7e812c298a23a00af8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,157,40,167,55,24,144,98,158,167,43,126,129,44,41,138,35,160,10,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
