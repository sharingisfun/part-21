A few hours later, the local police chief received orders to execute them. Almost all were innocent. In compelling prose, Rodolfo Walsh recreates the events of that night and its aftermath.\n\nPre-dating Capote's IN COLD BLOOD by over a decade, OPERATION MASSACRE is regarded throughout Latin America as the original work of modern 'true crime.'
