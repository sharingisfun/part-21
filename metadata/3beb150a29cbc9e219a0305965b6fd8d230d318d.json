The two have been in deep hiding with their father, Il Duce, in the quiet valleys of Ireland, far removed from their former vigilante lives. When word comes that a beloved priest has been killed by sinister forces from deep within the mob, the brothers return to Boston to mount a violent and bloody crusade to bring justice to those responsible. With a new partner in crime and a sexy FBI operative hot on their trailÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦the Saints are back!\n\n*** Small-sized 2-pass re-encode of screener of unknown source (wide-screen, line audio) for computers (PC, Mac), PS3 or Xbox, portable and mobile devices (Ipod, Itouch) . ***\n*** Video is 480x272 H264; audio is 44.1 kHz/stereo AAC LC and container is MP4. ***\n\nI recommend CoreCodec for H264 (avc1, x264) video-playback, free DivX 7 for AAC sound-playback (and .mkv with AAC), Haali splitter (free, comes with CoreCodec) as the fastest and best combination for Windows Media Player. This is what I use.\nVLC player (free), mplayer (free) and KMplayer (free) are available as alternative for all platforms (operating systems) out there and have BUILT-IN codecs and MP4 capabilities. But, video quality is approx. 10-15% lower, blurrier at least on system I have.\nOne can try CCCP matroska codec pack, where ffdshow codec/filter packs and Haali splitter comes in one package and support MP4 playback - but extra caution is required during the install process.\nQuickTime of course, supports H264/AAC natively.\nPS3 + HDMI cable + newer TV have been reported as best combination.\nAnd please, do not watch it with a nose in the screen, take proper distance to the monitor or TV (as advised in TV manuals).Many of movies I encode have embedded subtitles. So far, only VLC player is able to use them correctly.\n\n&quot;Home&quot; of my torrents (for Bookmark/Favorites in your browser) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/twentyforty&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/twentyforty&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3beb150a29cbc9e219a0305965b6fd8d230d318d","amp;dn":"The.Boondock.Saints.II.All.Saints.Day.2009.WS.SCR.H264%5BREQ%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3beb150a29cbc9e219a0305965b6fd8d230d318d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,235,21,10,41,203,201,226,25,160,48,89,101,182,253,141,35,13,49,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
