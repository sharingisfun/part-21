Her smoky voice is sultry, yet she's ironically humorous and candid while reshaping traditional standards and pop classics. Jazz is her bedrock, but not exclusively. \n &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/holly-cole-p10331&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/holly-cole-p10331&lt;/a&gt;\n\n&quot;The House Is Haunted by the Echo of Your Last Goodbye&quot; is an overlooked gem in which Cole adds the slightest touch of humor to lessen its melancholy air. The brisk setting of Henry Mancini's normally easygoing &quot;Charade&quot; suggests the hustle and bustle of a love affair in an urban setting, while the breezy dash through &quot;It's Alright with Me&quot; is just as much fun. Her slinky treatment of the old novelty piece &quot;Alley Cat Song&quot; (usually heard as a honky tonk piano instrumental) could revive interest in its possibilities. Only one piece falls short, her droning take of Jobim's &quot;Waters of March,&quot; featuring members of her old band (pianist Aaron Davis, bassist David Piltch, and guitarist Kevin Breit, the latter adding loops as well), where she fails to vary her approach enough to capture the subtlety within this demanding song. But this CD is easily one of her best overall record dates. ~ Ken Dryden, Rovi\n\nTrack listing\n\n1. &quot;The House Is Haunted by the Echo of Your Last Goodbye&quot; (Adlam, Rose) - 4:17\n2. &quot;Charade&quot; (Mancini, Mercer) - 3:25\n3. &quot;I Will Wait for You&quot; (Gimbel, Legrand) - 4:31\n4. &quot;Waters of March&quot; (Jobim) - 4:22\n5. &quot;Alley Cat Song&quot; (Bjorn, Harlen) - 4:03\n6. &quot;Larger Than Life&quot; (Cole) - 3:37\n7. &quot;Be Careful, It's My Heart&quot; (Berlin) - 2:06\n8. &quot;It's Alright with Me&quot; (Porter) - 3:51\n9. &quot;You're My Thrill&quot; (Clare, Gorney) - 5:46\n10. &quot;Life Is Just a Bowl of Cherries&quot; (Brown, Henderson) - 3:04\n11. &quot;Reaching for the Moon&quot; (Berlin) - 4:06\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32bc909102369f2b81f73c3369ee611e90452c44","amp;dn":"Holly+Cole+-+This+House+Is+Haunted+%282008%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32bc909102369f2b81f73c3369ee611e90452c44","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,188,144,145,2,54,159,43,129,247,60,51,105,238,97,30,144,69,44,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
