Apologies for the digression into enigmatic French footballing legends-cum-actors, but given that the video for new single Ã¢â‚¬ËœLikeLikeLikeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ features Hunger practicing her own flicksÃ¢â‚¬â„¢nÃ¢â‚¬â„¢tricks on the streets of Paris she looks quite the playmaker herself. In fact HungerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s silkiest moves (in heels no less) set to the jazzy swing and ascending Ã¢â‚¬Å“la-la-laaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ chorus refrain is incredibly joyous. However, take the song on its own and youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re left with something vaguely catchy and, depending on your tastes, either coyingly chipper or just blandly MOR.\n\nIn shorthand, HungerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s output could be described as acoustic folk-pop with a jazzy flavour. Indeed it was at the Montreaux Jazz Festival that she made a name for herself. Unfortunately the jazz element to be found on The Danger of Light is at best toothless and at worst smug. This is particularly true of the recordÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more uptempo numbers such as Ã¢â‚¬ËœLikeLikeLikeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and the shuffling Ã¢â‚¬ËœDas NeueÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, which might be breezy if somewhat vanilla pop, but for the intrusive faux-jazz squeals of brass and off-kilter piano chords. On the other hand Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe PerpetratorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ goes for smoky jazz club seduction crossed with a hint of bluesy guitar growl, but it never succeeds at being anything other pastiche, and HungerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Florence-style bawling on the chorus rather undermines her claim to Ã¢â‚¬Å“I move with grace and eleganceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n\nIn fairness there are more nuances at work on The Danger of Light, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s in details that the album's virtues are too often undone by its flaws. The clumsily titled Ã¢â‚¬ËœSouldierÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ goes from shadowy verses of pensive piano to a ploddingly dull chorus playing on the song title in predictable fashion (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Oh oh Soldier donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t break your shoulders for nothinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½). It would be more forgivable if it wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t so earnest. The same problem applies to Ã¢â‚¬ËœCan You See Me?Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ã¢â‚¬ËœHeharunÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, which are both stylistic standouts, the former for its trip-hop beats and the latter for its wonky freestyling guitar, but both have choruses that are too big on 'emotion' and too short on melody or invention.\n\nHowever, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s plenty to suggest that Sophie Hunger has better in her. Ã¢â‚¬ËœHoly HellsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe FallenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ see her utilise the brass section in menacing and rousingly urgent fashion respectively, quite detached from their jazz origins. On album opener Ã¢â‚¬ËœRererevolutionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ piano and woodwinds are used to haunting effect between urgent drum led passages. Meanwhile, &quot;Z'Lied Vor Freiheitsstatue' sits immovably in the middle of the road, but is an undeniably beautiful piano torch song. However, Hunger leaves the best for last with the rustic fingerpicking of Ã¢â‚¬ËœTake a TurnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, perhaps her most conventional singer-songwriter moment and certainly the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most affecting one. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just a shame she spends so much time being a sort of frustrating cross between Sharon Van Etten and Norah Jones.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a17e7bc070565e38307b7bf6c2cab20025e1a0a","amp;dn":"Sophie+Hunger+-+The+Danger+Of+Light+%5B2012%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a17e7bc070565e38307b7bf6c2cab20025e1a0a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,23,231,188,7,5,101,227,131,7,183,191,108,44,171,32,2,94,26,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
