The Metabarons series was written by creator Alejandro Jodorowsky and illustrated by Argentinian artist Juan Gimenez. The series, published by HumanoÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯des AssociÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©s, is complete, the last volume having been released at the end of 2003.\n\nThe first appearance of a Metabaron (chronologically the last of the Metabarons) was May 1981 in the Incal comic book series as a supporting character. This was followed by a series of prequels that concerned this character's origin, presented as the narration of the droid Tonto to the droid Lothar, of his masters' achievements. The series takes place over the course of several generations, and chronicles the life of each of the five Metabarons. The stories are characterized by science fantasy on an epic scale, a background against which a space opera reminiscient of Greek tragedy plays out. The stories are also heavily influenced by Frank Herbert's Dune novels. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabarons&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabarons&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:803fdc42fcfe7b737d413027f6cc848fd402879a","amp;dn":"Jodorowsky+%26+Gimenez+-+The+Metabarons+-+Complete+%5BCBR%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"803fdc42fcfe7b737d413027f6cc848fd402879a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,63,220,66,252,254,123,115,125,65,48,39,246,204,132,143,212,2,135,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
