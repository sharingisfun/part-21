With his characteristic brutal honesty, Mooney passionately and hysterically charges into the electrified currents of racial tension. In this magnificent standup performance at Hollywood's Laugh Factory, Mooney earns a standing ovation with his relentless no-holds-barred observations on black history, stereotypes and prejudices, living in White America, celebrity divas and much, much more!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:60f3f7c81053964dafebf7be8caea938707fc887","amp;dn":"Paul+Mooney%3A+Know+Your+History-Jesus+Was+Black.+So+Was+Cleopatra","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"60f3f7c81053964dafebf7be8caea938707fc887","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,243,247,200,16,83,150,77,175,235,247,190,140,174,169,56,112,127,200,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
