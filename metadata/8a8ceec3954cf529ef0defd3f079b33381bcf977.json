Led through numerous incarnations by guitarist/vocalist Robert Smith (born April 21, 1959), the band became notorious for its slow, gloomy dirges and Smith's ghoulish appearance, a public image that often hid the diversity of the Cure's music. At the outset, the Cure played jagged, edgy pop songs before slowly evolving into a more textured outfit. As one of the bands that laid the seeds for goth rock, the group created towering layers of guitars and synthesizers, but by the time goth caught on in the mid-'80s, the Cure had moved away from the genre. By the end of the '80s, the band had crossed over into the mainstream not only in its native England, but also in the United States and in various parts of Europe. the Cure remained a popular concert draw and reliable record-seller rhroughout the '90s, and their influence could be heard clearly on scores of new bands during the new millenium, including many that had little to do with goth.\n\n\n1979 - Three Imaginary Boys [2004 Deluxe Edition]\n1980 - Boys Don't Cry\n1980 - Seventeen Seconds [2005 Deluxe Edition]\n1981 - Faith [2005 Deluxe Edition]\n1982 - Pornography [2005 Deluxe Edition]\n1983 - Japanese Whispers\n1984 - Concert: The Cure Live\n1984 - The Top [2006 Deluxe Edition]\n1985 - The Head on the Door [2006 Deluxe Edition]\n1986 - Staring at the Sea: The Singles 1979-1985\n1987 - Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me [2006 Deluxe Edition]\n1989 - Disintegration [2010 Deluxe Edition]\n1990 - Mixed Up\n1992 - Wish\n1993 - Paris\n1993 - Show\n1996 - Wild Mood Swings\n1997 - Galore: The Singles 1987-1997\n2000 - Bloodflowers\n2001 - Greatest Hits [Bonus Disc]\n2004 - Join the Dots: B-Sides &amp; Rarities 1978Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2001 (The Fiction Years)\n2004 - The Cure [UK Bonus Tracks]\n2008 - 4:13 Dream \n\n\nArtwork for each album is included.
