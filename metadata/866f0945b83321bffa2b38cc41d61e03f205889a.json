Although he could stomp with the best swing players and was masterful on the blues, Hodges' luscious playing on ballads has never been topped.  He played drums and piano early on before switching to soprano sax when he was 14.  Hodges was taught and inspired by Sidney Bechet, although he soon used alto as his main ax; he would regretfully drop soprano altogether after 1940.  His early experiences included playing with Lloyd Scott, Chick Webb, Luckey Roberts, and Willie &quot;The Lion&quot; Smith (1924), and he also had the opportunity to work with Bechet.  However, Johnny Hodges' real career began in 1928 when he joined Duke Ellington's orchestra.  He quickly became one of the most important solo stars in the band and a real pacesetter on alto; Benny Carter was his only close competition in the 1930s.  Hodges was featured on a countless number of performances with Ellington and also had many chances to lead recording dates with Ellington's sidemen.  Whether it was &quot;Things Ain't What They Used to Be,&quot; &quot;Come Sunday,&quot; or &quot;Passion Flower,&quot; Hodges was an indispensable member of Ellington's orchestra in the 1930s and '40s.  It was therefore a shock, in 1951, when he decided to leave Duke Ellington and lead a band of his own.  Hodges had a quick hit in &quot;Castle Rock&quot; (which ironically showcased Al Sears' tenor and had no real contribution by the altoist), but his combo ended up struggling and breaking up in 1955.  Hodges' return to Duke Ellington was a joyous occasion and he never really left again.  In the 1960s, Hodges teamed up with organist Wild Bill Davis on some sessions, leading to Davis joining Ellington for a time in 1969.  Johnny Hodges, whose unchanging style always managed to sound fresh, was still with Duke Ellington when he suddenly died in 1970.  ~ Scott Yanow, All Music Guide\n\nObviously I'm a big JH fan.  I find this (like the entire Verve Jazz Masters series) a winner on all counts: excellent remastering, a generous serving (77+ minutes), and a carefully selected cross section of the artist.  Well, there is one embarrassing moment when some fool tried to make a commercial pop-sounding &quot;Don't Sleep In The Subway&quot; (with strings!), but it is the genius of Johnny Hodges that he even transcends the bounds of this misguided effort.  If you aren't familiar with Jeep, he was the heart and soul of the Ellington horn section and on these (mostly) small group offerings you will be treated to the sweetest sound ever coaxed from an alto sax while never sounding syrupy or maudlin.  And he can (seemingly) effortlessly slide from his sweet sound to his more powerful blowing.  These Verve sessions from the 50's feature the alto master in his prime, with work featuring Ben Webster, Roy Eldridge, Hank Jones, Dizzy Gillespi, Charlie Parker, Benny Carter, along with the usual Ellington sidemen.  &quot;The Last Time I Saw Paris&quot; is particularly goose flesh inducing.  Criminal of Verve to let this one go out of print; buy from &quot;new and used&quot; before this title disappears! ~ Johnny Hodges\n\nVerve Jazz Masters 35 - Johny Hodges \n01  JeepÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Blues 2:55 \n02  Castle Rock 2:49 \n03  (A Flower Is A Lovesome Thing) Passion Flower 3:18 \n04  DukeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s In Bed 2:53 \n05  Little Rabbit Blues 9:22 \n06  Early Morning Rock 3:36 \n07  Honey Hill 4:04 \n08  The Last Time I Saw Paris 2:53 \n09  Not So Dukish 7:51 \n10  Back Beat 7:27 \n11  Gal From JoeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s 2:27 \n12  Rosetta 3:34 \n13  DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Sleep In The Subway 3:22 \n14  Funky Blues 13:27 \n15  Squatty Roo 7:26 \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:866f0945b83321bffa2b38cc41d61e03f205889a","amp;dn":"Verve+Jazz+Masters+35+-+Johny+Hodges+%281994%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3+160-320%5D%5B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"866f0945b83321bffa2b38cc41d61e03f205889a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,111,9,69,184,51,33,191,250,43,56,204,65,214,30,3,242,5,136,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
