This scenario has been designed as a demanding test for experienced Total War players.\n     \n    More information on Ã¢â‚¬ËœDestroy CarthageÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ by Times Bestselling author David Gibbons can be found here: http://www.totalwarbooks.com. Read the first chapter now at http://www.totalwar.com.\n     \n    New Playable Faction Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Getae\n     \n    The Getae are not a single tribe, but a loose confederation settled around the Lower Danube. They differ from other local tribes through their worship of Gebeleizis, who manifests himself through lightning and thunder, and Zalmoxis, who represents immortality. The Getae strongly believe there are no other gods than their own, yet see themselves as constantly at odds with the heavens, even firing arrows at Gebeleizis during heavy storms.\n     \n    Perhaps reflecting this natural fury, the Getae have the best skirmishers of all the barbarian factions; favouring lightning-fast hit-and-run strikes at the enemy combined with heavy-hitting falx-armed shock infantry.\n     \n    New Units Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Getae\n     \n    Heavy Skirmishers\n     \n    These elite missile infantry are a deadly combination of well-armed and armoured, especially when compared to other factionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s troops in a similar role. Suited to ambushing and softening the enemy before a charge from supporting units, GetaeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s skirmishers are unparalleled within their culture.\n\nThanks to the original seeder\n     \n    Heavy Archers\n     \n    Elite bowmen are a staple of many Getae expeditionary forces, who consider a cloudy sky to be a poor omen for battle. Unless of course it is they who are raining GebeleizisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ fury on the enemyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s head in the form of thick clouds of heavy shafts and weighted arrowheads.\n     \n    Noble Swords\n     \n    Forming the hammer of any powerful Getae army, these armoured infantry will stoically push forward into the enemy line against the most incredible odds. While it is the purpose of other units to harass, break and shock, it is these elite swordsmen who have the grim, determined work of slaughtering the foe.\n     \n    DLC Preparation Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Pirates and Raiders Culture Pack\n     \n    This update contains content that will prepare the game for purchasers of the forthcoming DLC, the Pirates &amp; Raiders Culture Pack.
