And that's all. Nothing to be done.\n\nBeckett's influence has been profound. I know most members of this site clicking on this link are probably versed in modern British theatre--but if there are other people from the States who only know the name Beckett, like myself a couple years back, they may be unfamiliar with the name Harold Pinter. If Pinter is a new name for you, but you've come to love the Beckett experience, put TheBox to use and look him up.\n\nIf you have an interest in &quot;the theatre of the absurd&quot;--a description coined by Martin Esslin, who along with being a theatre critic has produced radio dramas for the BBC--I recommend his book The Theatre of the Absurd. You can find Esslin's introduction to the book Absurdist Drama on the Net at this link.\n\nInformation regarding this production\nThis production of Beckett's Waiting for Godot was broadcast on the BBC R3 April 16, 2006 and was also released on the budget label Naxos as an audiobook. The reason they have chosen audiobook is twofold: (1) &quot;radio play&quot; is virtually unknown to the contemporary US market and (2) all Beckett's stage directions are read by a narrator.\n\nThe director is John Tydeman, head of radio dramas at the BBC for several years in the 80s and early 90s.\n\nCast\nNigel Anthony - Narrator\nSean Barrett - Vladimir\nDavid Burke - Estragon\nNigel Anthony - Lucky\nTerence Rigby - Pozzo\nZachary Fox - The Boy\n\nTechnical Information\nDisc 1\n\n1.
