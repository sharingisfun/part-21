I could go on and on..\n\nIt's the kind of book you don't really want to quit reading until you're on page &quot;the end&quot;.\n\n\nI wrote Br. Gray about torrents and sharing his material that way, and I received this answer [selection]:\n\n&quot;..It is the e-books that supply most of our profits for carrying out our\ncharitable work.\n\nI trust you understand.\n\nHowever, &quot;The Forbidden Secret&quot; is the result of two years' labour\nof love to get something completed that will be adequate on its own\nto supply the saving knowledge to anyone who honestly wants to\nknow the truth. We are taking no profit from that book.\n\nYou can share it with every unbeliever you wish, on the Internet or in\nvery other way you desire.\n\nI wish you you many blessings as you do this.\n\nBest regards\nJonathan.&quot;\n\nSo, with that I present to you this completely mindblowing book.. ;-)\n\nRegards,\nVerifire\nE-mail: &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;0b7d6e79626d62796e666a62674b6c666a626725686466&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nWebsite: http://www.blazefire.org\nBlog: http://verifire.blogspot.com\n\n\n&quot;Personally I've found the hope of deliverance and enlightenment through Yeshua Ha'Mashiach to be the greatest mystery and riddle, shrouded in the shadows of shame, but revealed to those who seek the Truth, no matter the cost.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:009f9d646d219f395ecf2b6a70c232f1c8984da9","amp;dn":"Forbidden+Secret+-+J.+Gray.pdf+%5BVerifire%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"009f9d646d219f395ecf2b6a70c232f1c8984da9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,159,157,100,109,33,159,57,94,207,43,106,112,194,50,241,200,152,77,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
