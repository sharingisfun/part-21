The 14-year-old auditioned for LaFace co-founder L.A. Reid, who signed the gospel choir boy to a recording contract. Raymond was introduced to the world simply as Usher, and released his debut album of the same name in 1994, which featured co-executive producer Sean Puffy Combs. The first single, Think of You, gained Usher wide recognition and reached gold status. From that initial exposure, Usher was approached to do other projects. In 1995, he recorded a national holiday jingle for Coca-Cola. He also joined several top male R&amp;B vocalists to form Black Men United for the single You Will Know, featured on the Jason's Lyric soundtrack. He also teamed with teen singing sensation Monica for a duet remake of Latimore's Let's Straighten It Out.\n\n+---------------+\n| Studio Albums |\n+---------------+\n\nUsher (1994)\nMy Way (1997)\n8701 (2001)\nConfessions (2004)\nHere I Stand (2008)\nRaymond v.
