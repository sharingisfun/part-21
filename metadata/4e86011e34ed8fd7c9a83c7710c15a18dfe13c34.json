And even if it has a pretty hefty price, it could be one of the best investments you've ever made.\n\nUser Interface:\n================\n-Windows Familiar GUI\n-System overview and recommendations\n-System tray shortcut\n-Shows Scan Progress\n-Shows driver statuses\n-Extensive Manual and Help\n-LiveUpdate\n-Inbuilt reporting system for bad drivers\n\nDriver Scan:\n=============\n-Scan summary and download history\n-Driver download management technology\n-Disk drives scan\n-Display adapters scan\n-DVD/CD-ROM drives scan\n-IDE ATA/ATAPI controllers scan\n-Monitors scan\n-Network adapters scan\n-Processors scan\n-Other devices scan\n-Sound, video and game controllers scan\n-System devices scan\n-Universal serial bus controllers scan\n-Unplugged devices scan\n-Simultaneous driver downloads","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e86011e34ed8fd7c9a83c7710c15a18dfe13c34","amp;dn":"DriverScanner+2013+Portable","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e86011e34ed8fd7c9a83c7710c15a18dfe13c34","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,134,1,30,52,237,143,215,201,168,60,119,16,193,90,24,223,225,60,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
