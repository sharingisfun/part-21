Searchable pdf (clearscan) with contents in bookmarks, accurate pagination and metadata, etc.\n\n\ndescription:\n\nWinner of the 1987 Pulitzer Prize for Biography and the Robert F. Kennedy Book Award, this is the most comprehensive book ever written about the life of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Based on more than seven hundred interviews with all of King's surviving associates, as well as with those who opposed him, and enhanced by the author's access to King's personal papers and tens of thousands of pages of FBI documents, this is a towering portrait of a man's metamorphosis into a legend.\n\n**\n\nReview\n\nIn this 1987 Pulitzer Prize winner, David J. Garrow, through extensive interviews, and access to F.B.I. transcripts, delves deeply into both Dr. Martin Luther KingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s leadership role and his private life. He attributes King's moral and physical courage to his religious faith: King believed that he had literally been called to do the Lord's work. But from 1965, when the F.B.I. taped King in sexual encounters and sent the tape to S.C.L.L. headquarters, his associates noted a &quot;spiritual depression&quot;, even a &quot;death wish.&quot; Fear that exposure would ruin his public work dogged him until his assassination in 1968. While documenting the F.B.I.'s dirty tricks, Garrow never loses sight of King's achievement and vision, nor of the poignancy of King's belief that &quot;the cross is something that you bear and ultimately that you die on.&quot;\n\nFrom Publishers Weekly\n\nGarrow (Protest at Selma), who teaches political science at the City College of New York, draws on 700 interviews and King's personal papers to depict the man's strength and vision as well as his failings and fears. PW noted that the book stresses King's &quot;philosophy of nonviolent resistance, coupled with love and tempered by realism.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2cfe4e52b3d3db64751960a876f06d5d789f9caf","amp;dn":"David+Garrow+-+Bearing+the+Cross%3A+MLK+Jr+and+SCLC+%28pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2cfe4e52b3d3db64751960a876f06d5d789f9caf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,254,78,82,179,211,219,100,117,25,96,168,118,240,109,93,120,159,156,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
