There were also tracks that had been elbowed off the UK edition of Are You Experienced in 1967 to make way for &quot;Hey Joe&quot;, &quot;Purple Haze&quot; and &quot;The Wind Cries Mary&quot;. \n\nAs a result, the US version of Smash Hits - which reached #6 in its territory - although only including one &quot;smash hit&quot;, is more balanced and more representative of the band's career, yet still failed to include any tracks from Axis: Bold As Love, and only two from Electric Ladyland. \n\nHowever, the UK (612004) and Japanese mono editions include the mono mix of the rare 1967 B-Side &quot;Stars That Play With Laughing Sam's Dice&quot;. \nIt is also available on CD on The Singles Album.\n\nA Japanese vesion was released in 1969, with a Fish eye photograph cover by Karl Ferris, Jimi's personal photographer/designer. In 1997, Experience Hendrix Inc. \ncompiled and issued Experience Hendrix: The Best of Jimi Hendrix, which currently stands as the definitive Hendrix compilation. \nHowever, this compilation was reissued and remastered in 2001. \n\nNeither the UK or US version contained tracks from the acclaimed 1967 album Axis: Bold As Love.\n________________________________________________\n\nCompilation album by The Jimi Hendrix Experience \nReleased April 1968 (UK)\nJuly 1969 (U.S.) \nRecorded October 1966-July 1967 (UK)\nOctober 1966-May 1968 (U.S.) \nGenre Rock, hard rock, psychedelic rock, blues rock \nLength 44:31 \nLabel MCA \nProducer Chas Chandler (UK)\nChas Chandler and Jimi Hendrix (U.S.) \n\n__________________________________________________\n\n01.&quot;Purple Haze&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:52 \n\n02.&quot;Fire&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:45 \n\n03.&quot;The Wind Cries Mary&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:20\n\n04.&quot;Can You See Me&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:33\n\n05.&quot;51st Anniversary&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:16\n\n06.&quot;Hey Joe&quot; (Roberts) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:30\n\n07.&quot;Stone Free&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:36\n\n08.&quot;The Stars That Play With Laughing Sam's Dice&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:21\n\n09.&quot;Manic Depression&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:42\n\n10.&quot;Highway Chile&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:32\n\n11.&quot;Burning of the Midnight Lamp&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:39\n\n12.&quot;Foxy Lady&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:18 \n\n_______________________\n\nMp3\n\nRipped:320kbs\n\nEnjoy \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37b5ebbc299b3b82c08dbbe19e2eeb779ae95be5","amp;dn":"Jimi+Hendrix+Experience+Smash+Hits%28mp3+320kbs%29ICM369","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37b5ebbc299b3b82c08dbbe19e2eeb779ae95be5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,181,235,188,41,155,59,130,192,141,187,225,158,46,235,119,154,233,91,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
