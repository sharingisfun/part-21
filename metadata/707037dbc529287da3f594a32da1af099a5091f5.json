While there aren't as many originals on this record as some of his albums released around this time, he manages to get something new out of several of his covers. Listening to &quot;Everybody's Talkin',&quot; you don't find youself longing for Nilsson's version. Similarly, after Jerry Lee ripped up &quot;One Has My Name,&quot; Nelson still makes it sound fresh.\n\n/Allmusic","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:707037dbc529287da3f594a32da1af099a5091f5","amp;dn":"Willie+Nelson+-+Both+Sides+Now+%281970%29+MP3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"707037dbc529287da3f594a32da1af099a5091f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,112,55,219,197,41,40,125,163,245,148,163,45,161,175,9,154,80,145,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
