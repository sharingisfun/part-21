The Alliance is engaged in a perpetual war with a tentacled alien species known as the Hideauze. 16-year-old Ensign Ledo is a soldier in the Galactic Alliance, piloting a Machine Caliber, an AI-automated, humanoid-shaped battle suit, which he refers to as 'Chamber'. After a failed attempt by the Alliance forces to destroy an enemy super-weapon, Ledo is knocked into a wormhole and loses consciousness. When he awakens, he learns from Chamber that he has been in cryo-stasis for 6 months while his wounds were healing. Ledo learns that he and Chamber have been 'found' by a rag-tag band of 'primitive' human scavengers. Ledo quickly discovers that he is on board a massive fleet of ships on an ocean-covered planet. Chamber tells him that local star charts reveal the planet is Earth, the birthplace of humanity, a place that members of the Alliance were only familiar with from stories and believed was a myth.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af467256f06f5219ba4b443a87624fc9d77a1b2b","amp;dn":"%5BCommie%5D+Suisei+no+Gargantia+%28Gargantia+on+the+Verdurous+Planet%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af467256f06f5219ba4b443a87624fc9d77a1b2b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,70,114,86,240,111,82,25,186,75,68,58,135,98,79,201,215,122,27,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
