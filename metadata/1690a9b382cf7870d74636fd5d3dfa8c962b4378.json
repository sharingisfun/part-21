In this humour-filled story, you mastermind the action as a general who has been ordered by his queen to get rid of her hated sisters in neighbouring settlements. Both you and your human or AI opponents have your own castles. Inside or around the castles you can also erect additional buildings and repair any damage to them as your power increases, giving you more weapons and magic. \n\nWith either mouse or keyboard control, your aim is to destroy a pre-determined number of enemy buildings and the goals become more challenging as the action progresses with battle ratings and medals to be gained and record lists to track your progress.\n\nFeatures\n4 action varieties and free game \n4 campaigns with 8 levels each \n3 multiplayer modes (hotseat, LAN, internet) \n14 buildings each with their own unique functions \n11 distinctive weapons; including catapult and rocket launcher\n\n\nAdded some high resolution wallpapers of this game.\n\nEnjoy!\t\t\n\nGerman version can be found here: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4612683/Ballerburg_(original_german_version)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1690a9b382cf7870d74636fd5d3dfa8c962b4378","amp;dn":"Ballerburg","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1690a9b382cf7870d74636fd5d3dfa8c962b4378","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,144,169,179,130,207,120,112,215,70,54,253,93,61,250,140,150,43,67,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
