It allows you to play stereoÃ‚Â­scopic videos and DVDs (external decoder required) and also allows you to watch live video from a capture device. Since it is based on DirectÃ‚Â­Show, it can handle almost any media format, for example AVI, MPEG, WMV and ASF. Videos can be coded in several different stereoÃ‚Â­scopic formats. Why is it necessary to use a special software for 3D movie playback? The reason is that there are a lots of different ways to watch stereoscopic content as well as different ways to store the content.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a57c7736b6dad017129249444df4afa2c3bc05b","amp;dn":"Stereoscopiayer+1.7.2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a57c7736b6dad017129249444df4afa2c3bc05b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,87,199,115,107,109,173,1,113,41,36,148,68,223,74,250,44,59,192,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
