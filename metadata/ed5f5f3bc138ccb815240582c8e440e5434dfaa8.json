The name of the entire series can get kind of confusing in conversations.\n\nTo all you fans of ultimate marvel; this contains everything up to june 21st. Read it, enjoy it.\nTo all those who never heard of ultimate marvel: Check it out. Start by reading ultimate spider-man, the first 24 issues of ultimate x-men or the ultimates v1 and v2. Spider-man and the ultimates are concidered among the best of marvel comics.\n\nThese are not my scans, so full respect to the original scanners. Though the older issues of ultimate x-men really need some better scans. Which is weird, since they are the only legally and commercially scanned ones.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed5f5f3bc138ccb815240582c8e440e5434dfaa8","amp;dn":"Ultimate+Marvel","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed5f5f3bc138ccb815240582c8e440e5434dfaa8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,95,95,59,193,56,204,184,21,36,5,130,200,228,64,229,67,77,250,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
