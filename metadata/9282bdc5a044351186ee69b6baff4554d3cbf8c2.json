While Virgos went under different monikers, lineup changes and name changes, the band made many contributions to the nu-metal/alternative metal movement in the late 90's and early 2000's. With very little of the band's content still in circulation (aside from Virgos Merlot's 'Signs Of A Vacant Soul' currently available on iTunes) these songs have been assembled into a torrent to provide old and new fans with a chance to keep Virgos's music alive amongst the community and capture the bands essense from The Devine's early beginnings in the early 90's to ViRGOS's last album in 2002, which would soon be followed up by Hestla's current band 'Dark New Day' in 2004.\nTrack List:\n1.
