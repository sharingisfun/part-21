They differ from other forms of life such as the micro-organisms and the fungi. Instead they resemble the primeval body of life and are generally known as &quot;Mushi&quot;. Their existence and appearance are unknown to many and only a limited number of humans are aware of them. Ginko is a &quot;Mushi-shi&quot; who travels around to investigate and find out more about the &quot;Mushi&quot;. In the process, he also lends a helping hand to people who face problems with supernatural occurances which may be related to the &quot;Mushi&quot;.\n\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Opening Theme:&quot;The Sore Feet Song&quot; by Ally Kerr\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Ending Theme:\n#01: &quot;Midori no Za (On Air Ver.)&quot; by Masuda Toshio (ep 1)\n#02: &quot;Mabuta no Hikari&quot; by Masuda Toshio (ep 2)\n#03: &quot;Yawarakai Tsuno&quot; by Masuda Toshio (ep 3)\n#04: &quot;Makura Kouji&quot; by Masuda Toshio (ep 4)\n#05: &quot;Tabi wo Suru Numa&quot; by Masuda Toshio (ep 5)\n#06: &quot;Tsuyu wo Suu Mure&quot; by Masuda Toshio (ep 6)\n#07: &quot;Ame ga Kuru Niji ga Tatsu&quot; by Masuda Toshio (ep 7)\n#08: &quot;Umi Sakai (Unasaka) Yori&quot; by Masuda Toshio (ep 8)\n#09: &quot;Omoi Mi&quot; by Masuda Toshio (ep 9)\n#10: &quot;Suzuri ni Sumu Shiro&quot; by Masuda Toshio (ep 10)\n#11: &quot;Yama Nemuru&quot; by Masuda Toshio (ep 11)\n#12: &quot;Sugame no Sakana (On Air Ver.)&quot; by Masuda Toshio (ep 12)\n#13: &quot;Hito Yo Bashi&quot; by Masuda Toshio (ep 13)\n#14: &quot;Kago no Naka&quot; by Masuda Toshio (ep 14)\n#15: &quot;Haru to Usobuko&quot; by Masuda Toshio (ep 15)\n#16: &quot;Akatsuki no Hebi&quot; by Masuda Toshio (ep 16)\n#17: &quot;Uro Mayu Tori&quot; by Masuda Toshio (ep 17)\n#18: &quot;Yama Daku Koromo&quot; by Masuda Toshio (ep 18)\n#19: &quot;Teppen no Ito&quot; by Masuda Toshio (ep 19)\n#20: &quot;Fude no Umi&quot; by Masuda Toshio (ep 20)\n#21: &quot;Wata Houshi&quot; by Masuda Toshio (ep 21)\n#22: &quot;Oki tsu Miya&quot; by Masuda Toshio (ep 22)\n#23: &quot;Sabi no Naku Koe&quot; by Masuda Toshio (ep 23)\n#24: &quot;Kagari no Kou&quot; by Masuda Toshio (ep 24)\n#25: &quot;Ganpuku Ganka&quot; by Masuda Toshio (ep 25)\n#26: &quot;Kusa wo Fumu Oto&quot; by Masuda Toshio (ep 26)\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Casting: \nYuto Nakano as Ginko\nYuji Ueda as Adashino-sensei","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:388febae9ceb0b5308cc2805258422949a1403c4","amp;dn":"%E8%9F%B2%E5%B8%AB%2Fmushishi%2F%E3%82%80%E3%81%97%E3%81%97%2FMushi-Shi%282005%291280x720%2C26episodes%2CCht+sub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"388febae9ceb0b5308cc2805258422949a1403c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,143,235,174,156,235,11,83,8,204,40,5,37,132,34,148,154,20,3,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
