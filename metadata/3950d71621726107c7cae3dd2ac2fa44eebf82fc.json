But this privilege comes at a price - extreme image control, including cosmetic surgery to transform her into a living logo for their brand.\n\nPresented with a way out, Dasha embarks on a hunt for the truth that takes her across a divided and CCTV-dominated city, in the company of maverick Londoner Latif.\n\nBut money talks and the Golds own the media. Who can Dasha really trust?\n\nGenre: Young Adult, Fantasy/Mystery","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3950d71621726107c7cae3dd2ac2fa44eebf82fc","amp;dn":"Stitch+Up+by+Sophie+Hamilton","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3950d71621726107c7cae3dd2ac2fa44eebf82fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,80,215,22,33,114,97,7,199,202,227,221,42,194,250,68,238,191,130,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
