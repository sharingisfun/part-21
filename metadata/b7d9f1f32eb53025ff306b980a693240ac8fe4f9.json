The Six Humoresques also arrive courtesy of Kang. These are magical bonbons - each weighted and balanced to perfection even though I favour the rawer vintage set glowingly recorded by Rosand and still available on Vox. True Sibelians must not miss these works and Kang and his orchestra do catch these silvery spells and confident little drinking songs - pride and eloquence, seduction and midnight poetry haunt these pages and it's all one especially well.&quot; --Rob Barnett (from the review of The Essential Sibelius, BIS-CD-1697-1700)\r\n\r\nNew York Times magazine:\r\nDONG-SUK KANG\r\n&quot;Readers of the right age may recall Dong-Suk Kangâ€™s high profile during the 1980s. With several prominent competition prizes and international dÃ©buts under his belt, his career went from strength to strength in the early CD era and his recordings won awards including the Grand Prix du Disque.\r\nKangâ€™s playing is easily identifiable as being of the strong, post - Romantic American school: his major training was with Galamian as one of the first flush of Far Eastern string players to emerge after World War II. His tone has great depth and, perhaps more than some of his contemporaries, extraordinary ease and fluency of which technique is the servant, making his recordings of late - Romantic and twentieth - century music particularly compelling. Isaac Sternâ€™s observation upon Korean artists is revealing: â€˜They are called the Italians of the Orient â€” they are cruder, warmer, more loutish â€¦ The freedom, turbulence, and passion show in their music making.â€™&quot;\r\n\r\nSix Humoresques, Op.87 and Op.89 for violin and orchestra\r\n01.
