Nut Rocker  \n\n \nAllMusic Review:\n\nIn addition to being a surprisingly effective and successful showcase for art rock Christmas music, this holiday EP is also well-representative of Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer\\'s sound across several decades. Opening with the original Greg Lake single \\&quot;I Believe in Father Christmas,\\&quot; featuring a full orchestral backing, it then jumps ahead 20 years to Troika (from Prokofiev\\'s Lieutenant Kije Suite), as done by Keith Emerson -- utilizing the same musical source that Lake and Peter Sinfield appropriated for \\&quot;I Believe in Father Christmas\\&quot; (and which, in turn, is familiar to millions of filmgoers for its use in Ronald Neame\\'s The Horse\\'s Mouth and Woody Allen\\'s Love and Death), the music becomes a showcase for Emerson\\'s nimble-fingered keyboard work. Then comes \\&quot;Humbug,\\&quot; a suitably good-humored instrumental -- highlighted by some virtuoso clarinet -- that was the B-side of the Lake single. The 1977 ELP version of \\&quot;I Believe in Father Christmas\\&quot; from Works, Vol. 2 follows, leaner and less opulent than Lake\\'s solo version and featuring Emerson and Carl Palmer\\'s playing. And the entire disc ends with ELP\\'s version of Kim Fowley\\'s \\&quot;Nutrocker\\&quot; from Pictures at an Exhibition, a flashy rendering of a part of the Tchaikovsky Nutcracker Suite, which leaves one with a pleasant progressive rock take on the holiday, surprisingly without too much pretentiousness.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:544e797ca24e0c1d1d6b413739f9b41b3823a346","amp;dn":"Emerson+Lake+%26+Palmer+-+I+Believe+in+Father+Christmas+%5BEP%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"544e797ca24e0c1d1d6b413739f9b41b3823a346","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,78,121,124,162,78,12,29,29,107,65,55,57,249,180,27,56,35,163,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
