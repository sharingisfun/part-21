Favorite songs such as &quot;Rocky Mountain High,&quot; &quot;Wild Montana Skies,&quot; and &quot;Fly Away&quot; are moving and gain fresh perspective from brief comments by Denver. Lesser-known songs like &quot;Eagles and Horses&quot; and &quot;You Say the Battle Is Over&quot; celebrate the spirit of animals and nature while underlining the importance of preservation. Succinct interview clips express Denver's commitment to nature: exploring man's basic hunger for the wild, the dichotomy between the uncultivated and the city, and the power of the individual to effect preservation and change. Striking though brief footage of wild animals like horses, eagles, penguins, and elephants in their natural habitats serve as bookends to the presentation. The Wildlife Concert is a reflective and moving musical celebration of the American West.\n\nAll songs written or co-written by John Denver except &quot;I Guess He'd Rather Be In Colorado&quot; (Bill Danoff/Taffy Nivert), &quot;You Say The Battle Is Over&quot; (David Mallett), &quot;Darcy Farrow&quot; (Tom Campbell/Steve Gillette), &quot;Me And My\n\nRecorded live at Sony Music Studios, New York on February 23 and 24, 1995.\n\nPersonnel: John Denver (vocals, acoustic guitar, piano); Pete Huttlinger (guitar, banjo, mandolin, background vocals); Belinda Whitney Barrett, Karen Karlsrud (violin); Jennie Hansen (viola); Caryl Paisner (cello); Chris Nole (piano, synthesizer, background vocals); Alan Deremo (bass, background vocals); Michito Sanchez (percussion); Pat Hawk (background vocals).\n\n- Bitrate: 320 Kbps\n- Encoding Library: LAME 3.98 (Max 0.9.1) / LAME3.98 \n- Format: Mpeg-1 layer 3 (mp3)\n- Profile: Layer 3\n- Bitrate: 320 Kbps\n- Bitrate mode: Constant\n- Resolution: 16 bits\n- Rate: 44.1 KHz\n- Channel(s): 2 (stereo)\n\nDisc One\n Rocky Mountain High\n Rhymes and Reasons\n Country Roads\n Back Home Again\n I Guess He'd Rather Be In Colorado\n Matthew\n Sunshine On My Shoulders\n You Say The Battle Is Over\n Eagles and Horses\n Darcy Farrow\n Whispering Jesse\n Me and My Uncle\n Wild Montana Skies\n Medley: Leaving On A Jet Plane/Goodbye Again\n\nDisc Two\n Bet On the Blues\n The Harder They Fall\n Shanghai Breezes\n Fly Away\n A Song For All Lovers\n Dreamland Express\n For You\n Is It Love?\n Falling Out of Love\n Annie's Song\n Poems, Prayers and Promises\n Calypso\n Amazon\n This Old Guitar","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:75ad070f03f676fceef404bb6dd7ba7bb87c4758","amp;dn":"John+Denver-The+Wildlife+Concert","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"75ad070f03f676fceef404bb6dd7ba7bb87c4758","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,173,7,15,3,246,118,252,238,244,4,187,109,215,186,123,184,124,71,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
