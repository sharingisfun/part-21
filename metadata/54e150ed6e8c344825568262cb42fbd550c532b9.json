Is the body found in the lake, under the unseeing gaze of the Bethesda angel, the first victim of a deranged psychopath, or is the case connected to other missing girls and women in years past whose remains have never been found? Just as the trio gets their first lead, the investigation is almost derailed when Mike and Alex become embroiled in a scandal.\n\nAs Alex attempts to fight the accusations leveled against her and Mike, she follows clues that range from the parkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most buried Ã¢â‚¬â€ literally Ã¢â‚¬â€ secrets all the way to the majestic Dakota, which has experienced its own share of tragedies. When another young woman is attacked in the park, a new question arises: is this enormous urban park a sanctuaryÃ¢â‚¬â€as it seems to the thousands of New Yorkers and tourists who fill it every dayÃ¢â‚¬â€or is it a hunting ground for a killer with a twisted mind?\n\nGenre: Mystery/Thriller","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54e150ed6e8c344825568262cb42fbd550c532b9","amp;dn":"Death+Angel+-+Linda+Fairstein.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54e150ed6e8c344825568262cb42fbd550c532b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,225,80,237,110,140,52,72,37,86,130,98,203,66,251,213,80,197,50,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
