Edited by Reinhold Grimm with the collaboration of Caroline Molina y Vedia.\n\nISBN: 9780826415059 | 194 pages | PDF\n\n\nWith respect to German literature, and especially its poetry, Bertolt Brecht (1898 - 1956) must be hailed as the propagator and unsurpassed master of what he labeled &quot;rhymeless lyrics with irregular rhythm&quot;, a kind of modern verse that has long since become the all-important and all-inclusive model of contemporary German poetry.\n\nThis collection primarily draws on the poetry, in its original German with facing English translations, from many points in Brecht's career.  Also included are two prose works: &quot;Socrates Wounded&quot; and &quot;The Unseemly Old Lady&quot;.  With an authoritative introduction by Reinhold Grimm.\n\nVol. 75 in The German Library series from Continuum.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e2971cda968e0d72424885f903e1f8c08598d43f","amp;dn":"Bertolt+Brecht+-+Poetry+and+Prose+%282003%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e2971cda968e0d72424885f903e1f8c08598d43f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,151,28,218,150,142,13,114,66,72,133,249,3,225,248,192,133,152,212,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
