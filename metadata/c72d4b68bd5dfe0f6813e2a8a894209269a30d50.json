Every time someone makes a choice, a new, parallel world branches off from the existing one. Eating breakfast or skipping it, turning left instead of right, sneaking out instead of staying in bed ~ all of these choices create an alternate universe in which an echo self takes the road not travelled and makes the opposite decision. As a Walker, someone who can navigate between these worlds, DelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s job is to keep all of the dimensions in harmony.\n\nNormally, Del can hear the dissonant frequency that each world emits as clear as a bell. But when a training session in an off-key world goes horribly wrong, she is forbidden from Walking by the Council. But DelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not big on following the rules and she secretly starts to investigate these other worlds. Something strange is connecting them and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not just her random encounters with echo versions of the guy she likes, Simon Lane.\n\nBut DelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s decisions have unimaginable consequences and, as she begins to fall for the Echo Simons in each world, she draws closer to a truth that the Council of Walkers is trying to hide ~ a secret that threatens the fate of the entire multiverse.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c72d4b68bd5dfe0f6813e2a8a894209269a30d50","amp;dn":"Dissonance+by+Erica+O%27Rourke+%28retail%29+%7Bdwg%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c72d4b68bd5dfe0f6813e2a8a894209269a30d50","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,45,75,104,189,93,254,15,104,19,226,168,168,148,32,146,105,163,13,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
