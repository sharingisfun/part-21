This collection of songs deals with revenge, hellfire and killing in the name of God. It also includes guest vocals by Lonesome Wyatt of Those Poor Bastards on the song, Blood in the Valley.\nSons of Perdition play psalms for the spiritually dead. Running wide-eyed \nthrough the dusty attics of regional American music, spinning tales of sorrow, \nmadness, revenge and soul gnashing woe, the Sons were spat forth from the mouth of an angry God. Listen and repent. The brooding child of Zebulon Whatley, of the undecayed Whatleys, Scrougout clan, Sons of Perdition are probably haunting a church or tent revival near you. Pass the arsenic and hand over that serpent, brother.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af45e953db2e7654b55a564d2bc80425f089f518","amp;dn":"Sons+Of+Perdition+-++The+Kingdom+On+Fire+%282008%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af45e953db2e7654b55a564d2bc80425f089f518","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,69,233,83,219,46,118,84,181,90,86,77,43,200,4,37,240,137,245,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
