In the late 1980s the orphaned Karl Koch invests his heritage in a flat and a home computer. At first he dials up to bulletin boards to discuss conspiracy theories inspired by his favorite novel, R.A. Wilson&amp;#039;s &quot;Illuminatus&quot;, but soon he and his friend David start breaking into government and military computers. Pepe, one of Karl&amp;#039;s rather criminal acquaintances senses that there is money in computer cracking - he travels to east Berlin and tries to contact the KGB.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:620859b291258ae509c540917f2d5d9fe28d8ca9","amp;dn":"23.-.Nichts.Ist.So.Wie.Es.Scheint.Dvd.Divx.German","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"620859b291258ae509c540917f2d5d9fe28d8ca9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,8,89,178,145,37,138,229,9,197,64,145,127,45,93,159,226,141,140,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
