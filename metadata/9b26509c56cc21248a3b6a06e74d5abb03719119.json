The Camel Trophy, the world's greatest amateur expedition, was the original testing ground for teamwork, sportsmanship and human endurance.  Teams from around the world were invited to embark on remarkable and challenging 4x4 adventurs, and asked to survive using their wits, bare knuckles and capable power of the Land Rover,\n\nThis superbly photographed production revisitys the action from 1989 to 1998 - the glory days of the Land Rver.  During this time a range of vehicles was pushed to the limit and beyond as they tackled some of the toughest terrain on the planet.  The 110, Range Rover, Discovery and Freelander all made their mark during this period as they battled arctic, tropical or torrential weather conditions.\n\nIn addition o the footage from 89 to 98, we bring you superb on-board action from Team UK in 1991, a behind-the-scenes look at team celebrations and an examination of the build of the Defender and Freelander.\n\nWatch this film and be struck by the physical, mental and mechanical strength that drove the teams to the finish line.  It\\'s time to pay homage to Land Rover and celebrate the blood, sweat, and tears and smiles of a truly heroic era.\n\n\nDVD-rip AutoGK\nFile: Camel Trophy Land Rover Years.avi\nSize 698 MB\nMuxer: VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1\nDuration: 1:30:59:787\nVideo Codec: XVID\nDimensions: 384x288\nFrame Rate: 29 frames/second\nTotal Bitrate: 134kbps\nAspect: 4:3\nAudio Codec: MP3\nSampling Rate: 48K\nBit Rate: 105 kbps\n\nMy other Camel Trophy video can be found here:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4642118/10_Years_of_Camel_Trophy__amp__Camel_Trophy_4x4_Driving_Lessons&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4642118/10_Years_of_Camel_Trophy__amp__Camel_Trophy_4x4_Driving_Lessons&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b26509c56cc21248a3b6a06e74d5abb03719119","amp;dn":"Camel+Trophy+Land+Rover+Years+89+-+98","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b26509c56cc21248a3b6a06e74d5abb03719119","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,38,80,156,86,204,33,36,138,59,106,6,231,77,90,187,3,113,145,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
