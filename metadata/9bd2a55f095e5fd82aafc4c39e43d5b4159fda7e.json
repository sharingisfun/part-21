Virtually everything we think and do is generated by questions. Questions push us into new territories. The future begins with our thinking, represented by the questions we ask ourselves.&quot;Change Your Questions, Change Your Life&quot; shows readers how to consistently choose the questions that can lead them to success, both personally and professionally. This technique, called &quot;QuestionsThinking,&quot; stimulates innovation, accelerate productivity, and create more rewarding relationships.\n\n&quot;Change Your Questions, Change Your Life&quot; is a personal growth fable that tells how a seasoned executive, Ben Knight, uses QuestionThinking to move into a higher leadership role and how the same methods of change help him and his wife, Grace, enrich their marriage.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9bd2a55f095e5fd82aafc4c39e43d5b4159fda7e","amp;dn":"Change+Your+Questions%2C+Change+Your+Life+-+Marilee+Adams.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9bd2a55f095e5fd82aafc4c39e43d5b4159fda7e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,210,165,95,9,94,95,216,42,175,196,195,158,67,213,180,21,159,218,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
