But, alas, it is 2009 and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œProm QueenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is blowing up and all I have playing out my speakers is this new mixtape, My Face CanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Be Felt. And, you know, IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m okay with that, because this mixtape is good. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s obvious Wayne still plans on putting the project out someday because he and Juelz are still recording new stuff, so yes, drop T-Wayne, because IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m a patient dude who can wait a little longer. Just as long as these mixtapes keep popping up.\n\n\n01 Lil Wayne + Juelz Santana - Rock Hard\n02 Lil Wayne + Juelz Santana - Does What She Wants\n03 Lil Wayne + Juelz SantanaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Bonified Hustla\n04 Lil Wayne + Juelz Santana - With 1 arm\n05 Lil Wayne + Juelz Santana - No More\n06 Lil Wayne - How Can Something\n07 Lil Wayne - I Heard (Feat.
