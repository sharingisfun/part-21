Joining up with his friends Tails and Knuckles, who give him a message \n\nfrom Dr. Eggman stating that he will take over the world in three days, Team Sonic\n\n is formed and the classic trio head off to stop Eggman's latest plan. But they \n\nare not alone on this endeavor, as other characters from the series form their own \n\nteams to find Eggman first. The Chaotix detective agency has been hired by an \n\nunknown client to find the Doctor, and they take on the name Team Chaotix. Rouge \n\nfinds Shadow (who was presumably dead) and awakes Omega unknowingly; after a short \n\nfight, Rouge decides they should team up to find Eggman and become Team Dark. Amy \n\nRose, Cream the Rabbit, and Big the Cat team up to find Cream's Chao Chocola, \n\nBig's Froggy, and Sonic, believing this all to be connected with Eggman. The \n\nplayer must control their chosen team to complete each stage, defeat Eggman's \n\nrobots, and complete boss battles against Eggman himself, as well as defeat the \n\nother teams that have formed and stand in their way of finding Eggman first.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        ([[__|-'SUPER UPLOADER'-|__]])","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cbfdfa3773e7018fd7f790cf35dc85719867c2e6","amp;dn":"SONIC+HEROES+DX+PC+NO-RAR+NO-RIP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cbfdfa3773e7018fd7f790cf35dc85719867c2e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,253,250,55,115,231,1,143,215,247,144,207,53,220,133,113,152,103,194,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
