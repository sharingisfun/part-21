During this desperate  investigation,  she  developed\n the strange and unpredictable  power  of  post-cognition:  by  touching  an\n object, she can see its past and the events that happened on, to, or around\n it. Though undeniably useful in her line of  work,  this  skill  makes  her\n uneasy and has caused her problems professionally and personally. Now a new\n serial killer is on the move - one who leaves behind clues perfectly suited\n to Agent Reeds unique abilities. Has someone learned her secret?  What  do\n they want from her? More importantly: by  working  this  case,  will  Erica\n finally uncover enough evidence to bring her brothers killer to justice?\n\n Episode 4:\n\n In the intense finale of Cognition, the Cain Killer  resurfaces  and  Erica\n must work with someone she cannot trust to finish what  she  started  three\n years ago. But when the time comes to face  her  brothers  murderer,  what\n lines will Erica be willing to cross? Which will  she  choose:  justice  or\n revenge?\n\n\n Installation Information:\n =========================\n\n * Burn or mount\n * Install the game\n * Play the game\n\n NOTE: As usual, block the game exe in your firewall.\n\n                                                             /TEAM FAiRLIGHT\n\n\n                    +-+  QUALITY, TRADITION  AND PRIDE +-+\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:959631657d7fa911f6e9ef5820eb6c0c6bd0b610","amp;dn":"Cognition_Episode_4_The_Cain_Killer-FLT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"959631657d7fa911f6e9ef5820eb6c0c6bd0b610","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,150,49,101,125,127,169,17,246,233,239,88,32,235,108,12,107,208,182,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
