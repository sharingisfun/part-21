Normally a computer stores data on its hard drive. When it needs to access this data it searches the hard drive in sequence until that data is found. This inefficient process can create unnecessary delays in loading programs. Even if this data is accessed frequently the computer must still search through unnecessary data until it is found. eBoostr eliminates excessive loading times by avoiding this difficult process altogether. Unlike registry cleaners, eBoostr uses your computer\\'s hardware to improve performance. Rather than search through data eBoostr will create an intelligent buffer on solid state memory your computer can access quickly and easily.\nThis buffer is created utilizing resources from the computer\\'s processor, RAM and USB 2.0 memory in tandem. eBoostr will keep track of what programs are used most frequently and store relevant data on this buffer. Rather than having to search large sections of your hard drive, your computer will simply access the intelligent buffer created by eBoostr and load the data from there. Unlike the hard drive, all of the information located in eBoostr\\'s memory buffer is readily accessible.\neBoostr even tracks what programs get used most frequently, placing a higher priority on the programs that get used most often. This means eBoostr will adapt to the changing demands you place on your computer. Regardless of what you use it for, eBoostr will ensure your computer is running better than ever before.
