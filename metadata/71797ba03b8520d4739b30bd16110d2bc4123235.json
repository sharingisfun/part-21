We have to continue to press it. We must become missionaries for our valuesÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n Are Hispanic voters more motivated by immigration issues or government dependency issues?\n\n\nPrager 20121108  2 The Majority\n\nPrager H2: The implication from the media is that the majority (the Democratic Party) has it right...\n the minority (the Republican Party) has it wrong. \n Since when did the majority determine what is right and what is wrong?Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ \n Has a Chris Christie hurt his future political chances by so enthusiastically embracing President Obama\n after Superstorm SandyÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ \n 58 million Americans have withstood the liberal brainwash. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s impressive.\n\n\nPrager 20121108  1 Change Your Values\n\nPrager H1: The most spoken word in the last two days has been Ã¢â‚¬Å“demographics.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ \n Republicans must change their values to appeal to the new demographics.\n But maybe the answer isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t that Republicans need to change their values, but that Ã¢â‚¬Å“the demographicsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ need\n to change theirs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Dennis Prager Radio Show NOV-08-2012 THURS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n         Download, seed, and spread the word.
