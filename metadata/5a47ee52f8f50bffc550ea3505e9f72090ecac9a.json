His father, a clothing merchant (who also held a degree in engineering), died in 1943, when Cohen was nine years old. It was his mother who encouraged Cohen as a writer, especially of poetry, during his childhood. This fit in with the progressive intellectual environment in which he was raised, which allowed him free inquiry into a vast range of pursuits. His relationship to music was more tentative ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ he took up the guitar at age 13, initially as a way to impress a girl, but was good enough to play country &amp; western songs at local cafes, and he subsequently formed a group called the Buckskin Boys. At 17, he enrolled in McGill University as an English major ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ by this time, he was writing poetry in earnest and became part of the university's tiny underground &quot;bohemian&quot; community. Cohen only earned average grades, but was a good enough writer to earn the McNaughton Prize in creative writing by the time he graduated in 1955 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a year later, the ink barely dry on his degree, he published his first book of poetry, Let Us Compare Mythologies (1956), which got great reviews but didn't sell especially well.
