Some   |\n|   artists have a way of keeping the same style throughout each album, but    |\n|   SFK is changing. In the beginning, with the album &quot;Elsewhere for 8         |\n|   Minutes&quot;, they were more rock. &quot;Beautiful Sharks&quot; was more commercial      |\n|   with a bit of experimentation, capturing attention with rock songs such    |\n|   as &quot;Hallways&quot; and the catchiness of &quot;Electricity&quot; (which has an            |\n|   excellent riff). &quot;Echolalia&quot; brought the most public attention, a very     |\n|   commercially friendly album that seems pretty much flawless. Now with      |\n|   &quot;The Official Fiction&quot;, they've grown to add classy sophistication to      |\n|   their repertoire.                                                          |\n|                                                                              |\n|   The differences between this and past albums are evident. While the        |\n|   commerciality isn't as frequent, &quot;The Official Fiction&quot; is nonetheless     |\n|   quite powerful and emotional, and is best played during a quiet night      |\n|   in. And to get the most out of this album, one should pay close            |\n|   attention to the lyrics, and SFK provides some of the best in the song-    |\n|   writing business of recent times.                                          |\n|                                                                              |\n|   A brilliant example of quality lyrics is &quot;Best Weapon&quot;, clearly inspired   |\n|   by today's world. One can tell by the sinister tones in the opening bars   |\n|   that there is something disturbing going on. &quot;His machines all agree,      |\n|   let's wind them up and march them out / History repeated and read out      |\n|   loud - this could be our best weapon now...&quot; The second verse is even      |\n|   more powerful: &quot;Stripes and suits pushing the numbers through / They       |\n|   treat them like they don't exist / And they count them up like they're     |\n|   matchsticks...&quot; The lyrics are perfectly suited to the music, which has    |\n|   a haunting and emotional outro, with those two adjectives capable of       |\n|   pretty much summing up the entire album.                                   |\n|                                                                              |\n|   Another standout track is clearly &quot;Letter to the Editor&quot;, upbeat and       |\n|   energetic enough to capture attention, with a brilliant riff in the        |\n|   verses. However, the true essence lies in the lyrics, which comment on     |\n|   the media's interpretation of life. &quot;It's just information burned up,      |\n|   passed out, spun to your door...&quot; is a prime example, as are the           |\n|   choruses. This is a very meaningful song, with other lyrics such as &quot;and   |\n|   the choice of words is choose no words; say nothing, nothing at all&quot; and   |\n|   &quot;tell it like it is&quot;. This is a song to remember.                          |\n|                                                                              |\n|   The first single released from this album was &quot;Deja Vu&quot;, certainly a       |\n|   change from the released singles of previous albums. This is a powerful,   |\n|   string-driven track with lyrics of coincidence. It's a haunting piece,     |\n|   and the strings truly bring the song to life, before it softens for the    |\n|   ending. A terrific version of it (though with the lyrics slightly          |\n|   altered) was performed at Australian music's night of nights (the ARIA     |\n|   Awards), complete with a string section, so it can be brilliant live as    |\n|   well.                                                                      |\n|                                                                              |\n|   &quot;Song for a Sleepwalker&quot; was the second released single, and tames the     |\n|   passionate fire created by the more powerful tracks. It's sweet, with a    |\n|   gentle lightness that makes it accessible for commercial purposes, and     |\n|   elicits smiles. However, like with SFK's other released singles, it        |\n|   didn't stay for very long in the top 20 singles in Australia.              |\n|                                                                              |\n|   Like &quot;Echolalia&quot;, this album has a track best performed live. In this      |\n|   case, it's &quot;Light at the End of the Tunnel&quot;, with an acoustic guitar,      |\n|   strings and light female background vocals. This is one for gigs.          |\n|                                                                              |\n|   &quot;Max Planck&quot; is solid, a smooth piece that holds something somewhat        |\n|   emotional in the verses. &quot;Kaplan / Thornhill&quot; isn't particularly a         |\n|   standout, with a swaying feeling, and string instruments playing a major   |\n|   part in the outro.                                                         |\n|                                                                              |\n|   The only track that I personally don't think belongs on the album is       |\n|   &quot;Reverse Soundtrack&quot;. It's a slow track, and the problem with slow         |\n|   tracks is that if they're not special then they seem like time-fillers.    |\n|   Unfortunately, it is the later that describes this song, and it's a        |\n|   disappointment.                                                            |\n|                                                                              |\n|   The track positioning of the album shows that maybe this didn't go         |\n|   unnoticed, and so it seems as though attempts to make up for it are done   |\n|   with the following tracks. &quot;Coldwater Canyon&quot; is lightly upbeat about      |\n|   getting &quot;out of this still life&quot;, reasonably catchy. The last minute       |\n|   consists of strings only, but they are slower, and so I'm not quite sure   |\n|   if they fit in with the rest of the song. Meanwhile, &quot;Souvenir&quot; sounds     |\n|   as if it was written back in earlier years of the band, around the time    |\n|   of &quot;Elsewhere for 8 Minutes&quot;, perhaps, as it is upbeat, lively and         |\n|   catchy soft-rock, its best line being &quot;it's all money over mind over       |\n|   matter over miles of nothing, nothing here&quot;.                               |\n|                                                                              |\n|   One of my personal favourite tracks is &quot;Moving Right Along&quot;, which is      |\n|   the blessed feel-good track of the album. This is the song to hug - it's   |\n|   lovely, lively and cuddly, and you just have to adore it. The lyrics are   |\n|   about a friend never falling in times of trouble: &quot;They thought you'd      |\n|   falter, they thought you'd fail / But I knew better - you were just        |\n|   setting sail / And you were moving right along...&quot;                         |\n|                                                                              |\n|   &quot;Asleep at the Wheel&quot; goes back to slightly haunting soft-rock, with a     |\n|   snappy riff and interesting lyrics in the chorus - &quot;This is how we come    |\n|   and go, with ghosts for memories and memories for ghosts...&quot; And the       |\n|   final track, &quot;No Man's Land&quot;, has its opening bars and verses similar to   |\n|   the band's earlier work, but the chorus sounds similar to &quot;Deja Vu&quot;.       |\n|   It's nice, though not particularly outstanding, with good writing, but     |\n|   it doesn't feel individual enough.                                         |\n|                                                                              |\n|   Overall, &quot;The Official Fiction&quot; is powerful, sophisticated music, but      |\n|   lacks stability of strength. &quot;Reverse Soundtrack&quot; bogs down the album,     |\n|   and the next three songs seem to try to compensate for that. The first     |\n|   half is - for the most part - serious and dramatic, while the other half   |\n|   is lighter, so maybe this could be better equalised by mixing up the       |\n|   track order. The album could be viewed as an acquired taste overall, but   |\n|   it's a must-have for fans. Newcomers to the band's listeners may prefer    |\n|   to start off with &quot;Echolalia&quot; or &quot;Beautiful Sharks&quot;, but it really         |\n|   depends on what they're after.                                             |\n|                                                                              |\n+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\n    +------------+\n+---+ Track List +-------------------------------------------------------------+\n|   +------------+                                                             |\n|   No. | Title                                                  | Duration    |\n|   ----+--------------------------------------------------------+----------   |\n|   001 | Max Planck ........................................... | 00h04m41s   |\n|   002 | Best Weapon .......................................... | 00h04m47s   |\n|   003 | Song for a Sleepwalker ............................... | 00h03m54s   |\n|   004 | Kaplan / Thornhill ................................... | 00h04m44s   |\n|   005 | Light at the End of the Tunnel ....................... | 00h03m36s   |\n|   006 | Letter to the Editor ................................. | 00h03m31s   |\n|   007 | Deja Vu .............................................. | 00h04m26s   |\n|   008 | Reverse Soundtrack ................................... | 00h04m41s   |\n|   009 | Coldwater Canyon ..................................... | 00h04m23s   |\n|   010 | Souvenir ............................................. | 00h03m24s   |\n|   011 | Moving Right Along ................................... | 00h03m27s   |\n|   012 | Asleep at the Wheel .................................. | 00h03m55s   |\n|   013 | No Man's Land ........................................ | 00h04m17s   |\n|   ----+--------------------------------------------------------+----------   |\n|   Total Length ____________ 00h53m45s (3,224,972 ms)                         |\n|                                                                              |\n+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\n    +-----------+\n+---+ Audio Rip +--------------------------------------------------------------+\n|   +-----------+                                                              |\n|   Ripped with _____________ Exact Audio Copy v1.0b3                          |\n|   Encoded with ____________ FLAC v1.2.1                                      |\n|   Encoding Stats __________ 982kbps / 44.1kHz / VBR / 16 / Stereo            |\n|   Tag(s) __________________ FLAC / Vorbis                                    |\n|   Includes .LOG File(s) ___ Yes                                              |\n|   Includes .CUE File(s) ___ Yes                                              |\n|   Includes Playlist(s) ____ Yes                                              |\n|   Includes In-Tag Lyrics __ Yes                                              |\n|                                                                              |\n+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\n2011.12.18 @ 09:55:56.263","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ab3c57166cf9ea70bb629a16994aefc562a2fee","amp;dn":"Something+for+Kate+-+2003+-+Official+Fiction%2C+The+%5BEAC%2FFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ab3c57166cf9ea70bb629a16994aefc562a2fee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,179,197,113,102,207,158,167,11,182,41,161,105,148,174,252,86,42,47,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
