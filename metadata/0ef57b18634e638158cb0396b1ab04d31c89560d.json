Luerssen\n\nPorcupine Tree have always been pigeonholed with the modern prog movement, but the reality is that they're both a riff-addicted metal band and a troupe obsessed with rich harmonies and memorable refrains. Take the grinding guitar work of &quot;Shallow&quot; which dukes it out with frontman Steve Wilson's undeniably melodic chorus before easing into the delicate, beautifully crafted &quot;Lazarus.&quot; Few bands exhibit this kind of depth, be it the dreamy, Pink Floyd-inspired hallucination &quot;Halo&quot; or the QueensrÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿che echoes of &quot;Open Car.&quot; If the 12-minute sonic meander known as &quot;Arriving Somewhere but Not Here&quot; is as head-trippy as rock music gets anymore, it is reassuring to know that this Tree is still growing. Ideal for headphones, Deadwing -- despite its title -- takes flight nonetheless.\n\n\nPlease feel free to join TQMP!\nThe &quot;rules&quot; are simple: Rip your CD (no 1980's cassettetapes or vinylrips please!) in lossless format (flac is preferable) AND include artwork. Include the TQMP searchtag in your title, so it can easily be found. (Yes, on Google as well..)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ef57b18634e638158cb0396b1ab04d31c89560d","amp;dn":"Porcupine+Tree+-+2005+-+Deadwing+TQMP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ef57b18634e638158cb0396b1ab04d31c89560d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,245,123,24,99,78,99,129,88,203,3,150,177,171,4,211,28,137,86,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
