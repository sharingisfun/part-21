The recipient, Dr. Hendron, confirms the awful findings of the sender: the star Bellus will collide with Earth and wipe out all of humanity. Despite widespread disbelief, two philanthropists give Dr. Hendron some of the money he needs to build a rocket ship that will, at least theoretically, take them to Zyra, a planet which is orbiting Bellus which may or may not be habitable for humans. The rest of the money comes from Sydney Stanton, a wheelchair-bound old man, who insists he come along, despite the severe limitations on the number of passengers and amount of cargo. Meanwhile, as doomsday approaches, Randall is surprised to find himself in a love triangle with Dr. Hendron's daughter and her fiancÃƒÂ©. Humanity is in peril, and only a modern-day Noah's ark.\n\nAnother classic from my childhood.\n\nI know this has been posted before but thought I would run it again and seed. Some may have missed it.\n\nEnjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2916cf19083893253ea2b4712f81ba16fdd79c71","amp;dn":"When+Worlds+Collide+%281951+SciFi+Classic%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2916cf19083893253ea2b4712f81ba16fdd79c71","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,22,207,25,8,56,147,37,62,162,180,113,47,129,186,22,253,215,156,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
