Though sometimes dismissed as a novelty act because of this gimmick, critic Bruce Eder describes the band as &quot;underrated.&quot;\n The original group was signed to HMV in 1959 under the auspices of Walter J. Ridley. Their first single was the raw &quot;Please Don't Touch&quot;. This became a minor hit reaching number 25 on the UK singles charts in 1959. The song has since been covered many times, most successfully by the team of MotÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rhead and Girlschool known as Headgirl.\nAfter this initial success the band was reorganised to streamline the sound and visual appeal. Kidd would naturally take centre-stage at the front, but with Clem Cattini (drums) directly behind. Flanking Kidd on either side would be Alan Caddy (guitar) and Brian Gregg (born 31 January 1939, in London) (bass); and Kidd would high-kick in time to the beat. In an attempt to re-create the feel of his recordings Kidd employed the use of an echo unit on his vocals, one of the first UK rock acts to attempt this on stage.\n\n\n\nPlease SEED and enjoy, thanks........!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b14e95d030b71075e0e2a1fc4779f21557bc31e","amp;dn":"Johnny+Kidd+%26+The+Pirates-The+lost+BBC+sessions+and+more+rare+tr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b14e95d030b71075e0e2a1fc4779f21557bc31e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,20,233,93,3,11,113,7,94,14,42,31,196,119,159,33,85,123,195,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
