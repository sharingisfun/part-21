While at first listen it's tempting to merely lump the group in with their Swedish brethren like the Cardigans or Komeda, repeated exposure to Providing the Atmosphere reveals a unique band with a sound and style all their own; a number of tracks, most notably &quot;Nothing to Declare,&quot; &quot;Another Moment Follows&quot; and &quot;Some Things Are Better Left to Be,&quot; glide with the effervescence of '70s-era AM radio classics, while &quot;Going Further&quot; goes in a different direction entirely, employing sampled trip-hop rhythms and DJ scratching. Jennie Medin's vocals are sublime, enriching the songs with a cool-toned elegance -- imagine Julie London fronting Stereolab, and you're there.
