A dark plan, put into place centuries ago, has come to fruition. Consider Battle Hymn your wake-up call... Painstakingly researched through hundreds of sources and interviews, Battle Hymn rips the cover off the invisible government that controls our leaders and soon, our very lives. Composed of just a few hundred powerful but unelected people, this elite cadre seeks to create a one-world government to complete its already advanced globalist plans to end the sovereignty of all nations--including the United States. Its ultimate goal is complete control through a New-World Order where a socialist dictatorship ensures that every citizen is tagged, mollified and productive.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Battle-Hymn-Revelations-Sinister-World/dp/161296043X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1332186952&amp;sr=8-1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Battle-Hymn-Revelations-Sinister-World/dp/161296043X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1332186952&amp;sr=8-1&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac3021e248b24c0894e0be88dc9c71b8a33eeb48","amp;dn":"Battle+Hymn%3A+Revelations+of+the+Sinister+Plan+for+a+New+World+Or","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac3021e248b24c0894e0be88dc9c71b8a33eeb48","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,48,33,226,72,178,76,8,148,224,190,136,220,156,113,184,163,62,235,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
