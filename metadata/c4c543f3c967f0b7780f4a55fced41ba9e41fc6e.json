In the first episode, Victor, played by Scottish born actor Richard Wilson, was prematurely retired from his job as a security guard.

In particular, Victor fell victim to surreal misfortunes, bad luck and coincidences, which led to his oft-imitated catchphrase &quot;I don't believe it!&quot;.

The series featured highly innovative writing and outrageous comedy situations.
