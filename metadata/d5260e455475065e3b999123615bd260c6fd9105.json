Obscure, rare and unheard of but at the same time fantastic reminders of all the musical creativity that was going on in the early 80s. I gotta say I was damn lucky to have experienced it personally as a youngster. \n\nOne thing which is common about all these four records is that they are sold for crazy prices, of course should you come across a copy.  So hopefully they can now be crossed off someoneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wish list!
