Is she really careening from past to future and back, or has she lost her mind? And if her sanity remains intact, can one lone heroine possibly hope to end World War II by herself, a conflict still waged into the year 2013? As witness to generations of bloodshed and violence, Miss Fury has lots of righteous rage... and anger is her fearsome power!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:495658cc159954977b5a4189499e3c363a1f1132","amp;dn":"MISS+FURY+001+%282013%29+%28Dynamite%29+%284+covers%29+%28Tyrant+Lizard+King-E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"495658cc159954977b5a4189499e3c363a1f1132","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,86,88,204,21,153,84,151,123,90,65,137,73,158,60,54,58,31,17,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
