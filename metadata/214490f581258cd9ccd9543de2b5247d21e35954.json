Using the period's own macrocosmic-microcosmic analogy, the book examines family correspondence, wills, and court cases in addition to formal tracts to move outward from issues of spiritual profit to family values, employment relationships, and church and state. While England's experience provides a focal point, extensive use of continental sources reveals the problem's broader context. This study should prove particularly useful to those wishing to knit together the now particularized and separated strands of early modern economic, political, social, and religious history.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:214490f581258cd9ccd9543de2b5247d21e35954","amp;dn":"+The+Price+Revolution+in+Intellectual+Context","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"214490f581258cd9ccd9543de2b5247d21e35954","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,68,144,245,129,37,140,217,204,217,84,61,226,181,36,125,33,227,89,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
