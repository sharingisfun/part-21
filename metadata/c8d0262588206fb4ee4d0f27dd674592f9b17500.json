There are chapters on the composition of &quot;Jamaica talk,&quot; on pronunciation, grammar and vocabulary. \n\nThe book is an invaluable reference in all institutions that have language departments, and as a handbook for Jamaicans and for interested visitors to the island.\n\nGenre: Non-fiction","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c8d0262588206fb4ee4d0f27dd674592f9b17500","amp;dn":"Jamaica+Talk+by+Frederic+Gomes+Cassidy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c8d0262588206fb4ee4d0f27dd674592f9b17500","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,208,38,37,136,32,111,180,238,77,15,39,221,103,69,146,249,177,117,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
