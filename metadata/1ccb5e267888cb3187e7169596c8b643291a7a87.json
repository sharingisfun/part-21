This thoroughly up-to-date text shows how evolutionary biologists analyse all aspects of behaviour. It is distinguished by its balanced treatment of both the underlying mechanisms and evolutionary causes of behaviour, and stresses the utility of evolutionary theory in unifying the different behavioural disciplines. Important concepts are explained by reference to key illustrative studies, which are described in sufficient detail to help students appreciate the role of the scientific process in producing research discoveries. The writing style is clear and engaging: beginning students have no difficulty following the material, despite the strong conceptual orientation of the text. This is essential reading for degree-level students following modular programs in biology, zoology, marine biology, and psychology.\n\nContents ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Introduction to Animal Behaviour ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Evolution and Animal Behaviour ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Animal Behavioural Genetics ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Phylogeny and Animal Behaviour ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Animal Behaviour and Cognition ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Animal Learning and Development ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Proximate Mechanisms in Animal Behaviour ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Animal Social Behaviour ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Human Behaviour Patterns..............\n\n\n\n\n\n\nENJOY.........","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ccb5e267888cb3187e7169596c8b643291a7a87","amp;dn":"Recent+Trends+in+Animal+Behaviour-MANTESH","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ccb5e267888cb3187e7169596c8b643291a7a87","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,203,94,38,120,136,203,49,135,231,22,149,150,200,182,67,41,26,122,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
