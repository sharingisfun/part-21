A decisive battle between two large galley fleets was expected to decide the fate of the entire Mediterranean basin. In August 1571, an Ottoman fleet of some 235 galleys encountered the slightly smaller Christian fleet of the Holy League. In a five hour melee the Christians inflicted a decisive defeat on the Turks. Lepanto was the last great galley fight of all time and one of the most decisive naval battles in history. This book details the course of one of the most crucial military campaigns of the Renaissance.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca77f3890ab08c907b0b996af122de01c56c7a9f","amp;dn":"Lepanto+1571%3A+The+Greatest+Naval+Battle+Of+The+Renaissance","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca77f3890ab08c907b0b996af122de01c56c7a9f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,119,243,137,10,176,140,144,123,11,153,106,241,34,222,1,197,108,122,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
