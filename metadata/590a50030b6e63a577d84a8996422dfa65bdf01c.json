Allright at first look I thought this was a mislabel but after hearing it I was a little upset to find &quot;Scentless Apprentice&quot; cut-out and put in the middle of the setlist. Besides that, it is a normal copy of the 02/22/94 show. Also this is the only version of the show that I have seen with &quot;Heat-Shaped Box&quot; And &quot;Demolition&quot; are put together on one track, and it also includes the drum solo... so I guess that is a plus. Again pick up ROMA if you get the chance.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:590a50030b6e63a577d84a8996422dfa65bdf01c","amp;dn":"Nirvana+Tour+Over+Europe+Bootleg+1994","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"590a50030b6e63a577d84a8996422dfa65bdf01c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,10,80,3,11,110,99,165,119,216,74,137,150,66,45,250,101,189,240,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
