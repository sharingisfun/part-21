Like her mother, she is gifted in blood magic, able to read what has happened to a person through a mere taste of blood.\n\nHalf-human, half-fae, outsiders from birth, most changelings are second-class children of Faerie, spending their lives fighting for the respect of their immortal relations. Toby is the only changeling who has earned knighthood, and she re-earns that position every day, undertaking assignments for her liege, Sylvester, the Duke of the Shadowed Hills.\n\nNow Sylvester has asked her to go to the County of Tamed Lightning Ã¢â‚¬â€ otherwise known as Fremont, California Ã¢â‚¬â€ to make sure that all is well with his niece, Countess January OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Leary, whom he has not been able to contact. It seems like a simple enough assignment Ã¢â‚¬â€ but when dealing with the realm of Faerie, nothing is ever as simple as it seems.\n\nJanuary runs a company that produces computer fantasy games, and her domain is a buffer between SylvesterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s realm and a rival duchy whose ruler is looking for an opportunity to seize control. And that is the least of JanuaryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s problems. For Tamed Lightning has somehow been cut off from the other domains, and now someone has begun to murder JanuaryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s key people. If Toby canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t find and stop the killer soon, she may well become the next victim","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad91d7808fffa68d6fd6104e8cee349693d9723e","amp;dn":"A+Local+Habitation+-+Seanan+McGuire","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad91d7808fffa68d6fd6104e8cee349693d9723e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,145,215,128,143,255,166,141,111,214,16,78,140,238,52,150,147,217,114,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
