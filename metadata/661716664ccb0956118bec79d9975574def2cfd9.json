A ground-up re-imagining of the original Lone Wolf and Cub manga, this series is being done in association with, and under the watchful eye of Kazuo Koike, the writer and co-creator of Lone Wolf and Cub.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:661716664ccb0956118bec79d9975574def2cfd9","amp;dn":"Lone+Wolf+2100+Vol.+1+%282003%29+%28Digital%29+%28Son+of+Ultron-Empire%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"661716664ccb0956118bec79d9975574def2cfd9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,23,22,102,76,203,9,86,17,139,236,121,217,151,85,116,222,242,207,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
