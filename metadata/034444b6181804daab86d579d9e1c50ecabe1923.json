All the credits for they.\n Thanks MyDigitalLife.info\n Thanks hui.\n\n Change Log:\n - Fixed Notification Mode.\n - Fixed Service.\n\n Note:\n - If you install a Office Retail Version after the installation of KMSpico, then run again\n the shortcut KMSpico to make the conversion, because the Service installed only activate VL.\n\n Recommendations Optional:\n\n - Disable Microsoft Security Updates.\n - Make exceptions to Directory %ProgramFiles%KMSpico in Antivirus.\n\n How This Program Works:\n\n 1. Run KMSELDI.exe\n 1.1. Check Products Installed.\n 1.2. Convert Retail to VL if it is necessary.\n 1.3. If it found a non-permanent product it will converted. (hacktivators based in modified dll's ARE NOT PERMANENT) (MAK or OEM keys are the only ones PERMANENT)\n 1.4. Create a random kms emulator in memory.\n 1.5. Activate for 180 days all VL products installed against the emulator.\n 1.6. Close emulator and KMSELDI.\n 2. Install Service KMSELDI\n 2.1.
