Guys in fancy cars threw money at the camera while scantily clad women danced in the background. As he discovered how stereotypical rap videos had become, Hurt, a former college quarterback turned activist, decided to make a film about the gender politics of hip-hop, the music and the culture that he grew up with. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe more I grew and the more I learned about sexism and violence and homophobia, the more those lyrics became unacceptable to me,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ he says. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAnd I began to become more conflicted about the music that I loved.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ The result is HIP-HOP: Beyond Beats and Rhymes, a riveting documentary that tackles issues of masculinity, sexism, violence and homophobia in todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s hip-hop culture.\n\nSparking dialogue on hip-hop and its declarations on gender, HIP-HOP: Beyond Beats and Rhymes provides thoughtful insight from intelligent, divergent voices including rap artists, industry executives, rap fans and social critics from inside and outside the hip-hop generation. The film includes interviews with famous rappers such as Mos Def, Fat Joe, Chuck D and Jadakiss and hip-hop mogul Russell Simmons; along with commentary from Michael Eric Dyson, Beverly Guy-Sheftall, Kevin Powell and Sarah Jones and interviews with young women at Spelman College, a historically black school and one of the nationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s leading liberal arts institutions. \n\nThe film also explores such pressing issues as women and violence in rap music, representations of manhood in hip-hop culture, what todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s rap lyrics reveal to their listeners and homoeroticism in hip-hop.
