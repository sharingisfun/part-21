If you're Stevo (Lillard) and you live in Reagan-era \nSalt Lake City, then, well...you just have to rebel a little bit harder. \nTo this recent grad, the world is his enemy, anarchy his religion, and \nthe Ramones, The Specials and the Dead Kennedys his muses. As he takes \nus on a guided tour of his life, we meet all sorts of punks, poseurs, \nmods, freaks and a few others best described as indescribable. Stevo's \nex-hippie father sees his lifestyle as a rite of passage and urges him \nto attend Harvard Law School like himself. Not to sell out to the system, \nbut to buy in. For Stevo, underneath the mohawk haircuts, earrings and \nleather, the idea, painfully, has some merit. The question becomes; \nhow do you stay hard-core and still hope for a life beyond.\n\nStars.\n=&gt;-Matthew Lillard.\n=&gt;-Annabeth Gish.\n=&gt;-Michael A Goorjian.\n\nDirector.\n=&gt;-James Merendino.\n\nInfo.\n=&gt;-Genre......................: Drama : Mystery : Comedy.\n=&gt;-Release Date...............: 1998.\n=&gt;-Language...................: English.\n=&gt;-File Size..................: 1.37 GiB.\n=&gt;-Overall bit rate...........: 2 016 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Movie Runtime..............: 1h 37mn.\n=&gt;-SLC Punk 1998..............: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133189/\n=&gt;-SLC Punk 1998..............: http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/slc_punk/\n=&gt;-SLC Punk 1998..............: http://www.metacritic.com/movie/slc-punk!/\n\nVideo.\n=&gt;-Codec......................: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC.\n=&gt;-Aspect Ratio...............: 2.35:1.\n=&gt;-Resolution.................: 720 x 304.\n=&gt;-Bit rate...................: 1 898 Kbps.\n\nAudio English.\n=&gt;-Codec......................: mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC.\n=&gt;-Channels...................: 2 channel Stereo.\n=&gt;-Bit Rate...................: 112 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Maximum bit rate...........: 198 Kbps.\n\nSubtitles Softsubbed SubRip MicroDVD.\n=&gt;-English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:613e7b2e04276566ec0f1bc6e7aba30cf37efef5","amp;dn":"SLC+Punk+-+Comedy+1998+Eng+Subs+%5BH264-mp4%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"613e7b2e04276566ec0f1bc6e7aba30cf37efef5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,62,123,46,4,39,101,102,236,15,27,198,231,171,163,12,243,126,254,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
