The result is one of the best albums either one has ever made. \n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6f016d4e97c7cc5612d03750f836a083f59a2cd","amp;dn":"Brian+Eno+%26+John+Cale+-+Wrong+Way+Up","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6f016d4e97c7cc5612d03750f836a083f59a2cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,240,22,212,233,124,124,197,97,45,3,117,15,131,106,8,63,89,162,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
