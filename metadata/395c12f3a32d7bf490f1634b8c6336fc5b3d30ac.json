This CD is a lot better than I thought it would be. I uncluded a couple extras with it as well. The .rar has no password I only uploaded it as a compressed archive to preserve the file size.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:395c12f3a32d7bf490f1634b8c6336fc5b3d30ac","amp;dn":"A+Skylit+Drive++Rise+2013+CDRip+FLAC+Lossless+Quality","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"395c12f3a32d7bf490f1634b8c6336fc5b3d30ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,92,18,243,163,45,123,244,144,241,99,75,140,99,54,252,91,61,48,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
