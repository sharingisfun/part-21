Miracle of Allah and Final Testament to Mankind\n\nThe Qur'an represents the fountainhead of Divine guidance for every Human Being . The Qur'an confirms the revelations given to earlier Prophets such as Noah, Abraham, David, Moses and Jesus (peace be upon them all) All Prophets taught about life after death and gave glad tidings of paradise for those who obey Him The most sublime poetry in any language, and a rational message that directly appeals to the human heart, have caused this Divine book to move nations and civilizations\n\nNoble Quran\n\nThe Noble Quran is last revelation from our Creator and last divine book will remain sole guide for humanity. The matchless style of the Qur'an and the superior wisdom in it are definite evidence that is the word of the Creator. In addition, the Qur'an has many miraculous attributes proving that it is revelation from the Creator. One of these attributes is the fact that a number of scientific truths that we have only been able to uncover by the technology century were stated in the Qur'an 1,400 years ago. In the Qur'an, along with prayers, commands, prohibitions and high moral standards, our Creator communicates many secrets to mankind. These are truly important secrets, and an attentive eye can witness these throughout his life. No other source than the Qur'an holds these secrets. The Qur'an is the unique source of secrets that those people, no matter how intelligent, literate or astute they are, could never hope to find anywhere else.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed84cc9b7fcc7ea0f29f92ce6e595700338a95b8","amp;dn":"10+English+translations+of+Quran","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed84cc9b7fcc7ea0f29f92ce6e595700338a95b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,132,204,155,127,204,126,160,242,159,146,206,110,89,87,0,51,138,149,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
