I don't say that lightly, I don't exaggerate when it comes to talking about movies -- but everything about this one, from the acting to the writing, to the camera work, to the directorial decisions, is grade A. The story deals with deep matters, and it does so one step at a time, with a plot that moves steadily forward, gathering force, substance and intensity, not settling for easy answers or plot points, not cutting corners. The characters are complicated, interesting, believable, flawed, funny, tragic and deeply human.\n\nI prefer not to get specific about what happens -- I mostly want to try to get across the quality of this bugger. So I'll say it again: it's one of the best films I've ever seen, as good as anything out there. If there's any justice, a lot of people will see it.\n\n[ tjdinvt ]\n\nMultisubtitles in the opensubtitles","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7857ac32dd299bea0cfd7dd9a0e1c31c6eea924","amp;dn":"El+secreto+de+sus+ojos","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7857ac32dd299bea0cfd7dd9a0e1c31c6eea924","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,133,122,195,45,210,153,190,160,207,215,221,154,14,28,49,198,238,169,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
