The re-release that I am seeding is the one with Koshiro Matsumoto as Chamberlain Kuranosuke Oishi.  It shows Torshiro Mifune on the cover but while I am a major fan of his, this is not his movie.  He has a side part but is the most famous of the actors.  It is over 3 1/2 hours long with hard encoded English subs.\nI would have to say that for me this is the best as it captures the spirit and soul of those involved.  \n\nI will be adding classic style action films from Japan, China, Korea and Thailand.  \nAll will be DVD-R\n\nM.
