Shaporin) and conducting (under Professor A. Gauk). \nSvetlanov worked with the USSR Radio Symphony Orchestra, later took over the USSR Bolshoi Theatre Orchestra and since 1965 has been Chief Conductor of the USSR Symphony Orchestra.Under his direction, the USSR Symphony Orchestra became one of RussiaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s finest ensembles, and is particularly notable for its traditional Slavic sound. \nSvetlanov recorded widely, and his interpretations are prized for their color and vitality. \nWith Russian classics as the focus of his attention (his repertoire is made up entirely of Russian music), Svetlanov constantly tackles works of different styles. \nEvgeni Svetlanov is well known all over the world.\n \n\n\nSwan Lake Balett\n\nSwan Lake was TchaikovskyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s first ballet, commissioned by the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow and premiered in March of 1877. Although wildly popular today, Swan Lake was very coolly received at first, partly because the performance was poorly choreographed and performed. It was not until the great choreographer Marius Petipa revived Swan Lake in 1895, two years after the composerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s death, that the ballet achieved the success it deserved, and it has been a central part of the repertoire ever since. \n\n\nThe Nutcracker Balett\n\nThe Nutcracker was TchaikovskyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s third ballet and last completed stage work. The scenario was based on a fairy tale by E.T.A. Hoffmann and meticulously reworked by Petipa, who co-choreographed the premiere production in December of 1892. Again, the initial reception was cool, but it wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t long before The Nutcracker joined Swan Lake and Sleeping Beauty as repertory staples. \n\n\n\n\n\n1.
