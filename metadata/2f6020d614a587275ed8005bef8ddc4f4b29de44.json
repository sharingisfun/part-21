Listening to house and electro music sounds best when the tracks are mixed, and unfortunately, deadmau5 chose to release this album only in its unmixed state, unlike his previous few albums.\n\nWhen a house album is mixed, every song transitions into each other nice and smooth so it feels like the music never ends. Although mixed albums make it annoying to listen to the songs on shuffle, they make the album sound much smoother when you listen to it through.\n\nThis mix was made using the lossless audio files directly from the original CD, then converted down to 320kbps iTunes M4A for your convenience.\n\nIn order to provide the best possible listening experience, the track order was changed for this mix, and certain introductions needed to be cropped out. In addition, Tommy Trash's remix of &quot;The Veldt&quot; was used instead of the original mix, and two bonus tracks have been added (&quot;Where My Keys&quot; and the live version of &quot;Strobe&quot;).\n\nTRACKLIST\n#########\n 1.
