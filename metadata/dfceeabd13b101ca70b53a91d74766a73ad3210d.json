The inverse Ã¢â‚¬â€ that an album is more fun to listen to than to review or discuss Ã¢â‚¬â€ doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t come up as frequently. Los NiÃƒÂ±os de Cobre is an album that would live up to the inverse of that phrase. The qualities that make it compulsively listenable Ã¢â‚¬â€ its straightforward simplicity and the band membersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ passion and skill Ã¢â‚¬â€ also make it an elusive subject for review. The Copper Gamins have created an album that makes an ideal soundtrack to long walks in the early-morning magic hour and humid, sleepless nights.\nAt first glance, The Copper Gamins might seem like another neo-blues outfit in the style of The Black Keys ( Before they stared to churn out poptastic trash ) or White Stripes. All three bands feature only two members, have similar names, and perform songs that recall early blues efforts. While both The Black Keys ( used to ) and The Copper Gamins write the kinds of percussive riffs that stick in your head for days, the GaminsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ vulnerable lyrics and singer Jose CarmenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s trembling vocals contrast with Dan AuerbachÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sinewy approach to the blues. Likewise, the skilled, unfussy drumming of Claus Lafania sets the Gamins apart from the White StripesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ busy beats.\n\nThe duo instead takes a classic approach to songwriting and recording that suggests they skipped right past Led Zeppelin and went straight to 78s by Son House and Robert Johnson. Carmen and Lafania have an eerie, intuitive chemistry that you can hear in their riffs and in the interplay between the vocals and guitar. Their songs open with CarmenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s guitar sliding around LafaniaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s steady beat and curlicuing through the silences like ivy. Many of the songs play with the loud/quiet/loud dynamic in interesting ways, making the choruses quiet and the verses loud, for example, or amplifying parts of the songs that slow down.\n\nProduction on Los NiÃƒÂ±os de Cobre has an eclectic bent, ranging from muddled four-track recordings to more polished sounds that give the band a demystifying sense of clarity. The low-fi cuts work better since they balance the sound and keep the band from getting too high-endy. Because the production values have an inconsistent quality, the album sometimes sounds more like a greatest-hits compilation than a statement of purpose from a rising band.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dfceeabd13b101ca70b53a91d74766a73ad3210d","amp;dn":"The+Copper+Gamins+-+Los+Ni%26ntilde%3Bos+de+Cobre+%282013%29+MP3%40320kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dfceeabd13b101ca70b53a91d74766a73ad3210d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,206,234,189,19,177,1,202,112,181,58,145,215,71,102,167,58,211,33,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
