The one constant though has been singer/songwriter \nJackson Lee Taylor. Jackson's passion for music began as a little \nboy in Moody, Texas, a small town just north of Austin. His father \nwould take him to see the greats such as Willie, Billy Joe Shaver \nand Waylon. These musicians planted a deep seed in the heart and \nmind of that young boy. Jackson was heart broken when he and his \nfather moved to California to find work on fruit ranches. He and \nhis father spent the rest of Jackson's adolescence bouncing from \none migrant labor town to another, finally settling in a small \nfarming town in Washington state. After high school, Jackson \nmoved back to Texas for a while before going to Nashville. There, \nJackson found work as a songwriter for Of music, and for legendary \nsong writer Dewayne Blackwell. After a couple of years, Jackson \nhad to face the hard truth that Nashville would not let him produce \nand pick his own material. (&quot;I ain't got nothing against Tim McGraw \nor Mark Wills or none of those folks, but that just ain't the kind of \nmusic I feel in my heart. If I am going to do something I don't care \nto do, I might as well go back to school and a day job.&quot; ) Jackson \nmoved to New York City to play clubs, and found a vibrant live \nscene. There Jackson met the owner of a small Southern \nCalifornia label. Within a month of the meeting, Jackson was in the\nstudio recording &quot;Humboldt County,&quot; a record dedicated to his \nbrother who had died there the year before. &quot;Humboldt&quot; got great\nreviews and did well enough to gain attention from pop mogul \nGeorge Tobin. Jackson and Tobin struck a deal. After a year \nJackson realized Tobin was the same as the Nashville crowd; \nwhatever is on the radio is what you need to sound like. Jackson \nand Tobin where never able to agree on a song selection or \nsound, but they parted ways as friends. Jackson talked to his label \nand told them he wanted to go back home to Texas. Gaske had \nreservations, because Texas wasn't LA, Nashville or New York, but\nJackson said that was the whole point. Before leaving from Los \nAngeles and heading to Austin, Jackson went into the studio and \nrecorded &quot;Gypsies &amp; Drifters.&quot; After getting settled in Austin, \nJackson had to go back up North for a few months to play previously \nbooked shows. While he was there he recorded his third CD \n&quot;Hollow Eyed &amp; Wasted.&quot; Now Jackson is back in Texas where he \nbelongs, writing and producing the kind of music he was born to do.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9fdabf1b616806af8f534ba62895f689dcd6a87a","amp;dn":"Jackson+Taylor+-+Dark+Days+%5B2007%2FVBR218%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9fdabf1b616806af8f534ba62895f689dcd6a87a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,218,191,27,97,104,6,175,143,83,75,166,40,149,246,137,220,214,168,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
