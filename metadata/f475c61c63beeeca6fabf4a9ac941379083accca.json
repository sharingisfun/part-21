You can hardly accuse World of Weird of lacking variety. In its opening segment, it follows a Texan couple who have a pet, er, buffalo. He's called Wild Thing, and he wanders freely around the house, occasionally destroying bits of furniture and his outdoor fences.\r\nThings then move swiftly on to the Japanese phenomenon of hiring fake family members for social situations. Want to improve your social status? Just hire a bunch of actors to be your friends and relatives. Even presenter Matt Rudge has a go, acting as a fake brother for-in-law for client of the agency he visits. From there, it only gets more bizarre - a visit to BronyCon to meet die-hard male My Little Pony fans, including a 26 year-old accountant called David, a trip to a 40-acre secret fortress in the States where people pour their money into preparing for the end of the world, and bull-fighting 'mini-matadors'. On a slightly more serious note, journalist Billie JD Porter heads to a remote area of India to investigate Ziona - a man with 39 wives and 94 children. The family all live under one roof - a huge purple mansion, where Ziona lives like royalty. His 70th birthday party has military overtones and is described as a &quot;holy celebration like Christmas&quot; by one of the family members,\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/fd/World-of-Weird-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/7d/World-of-Weird-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f9/World-of-Weird-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/1c/World-of-Weird-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/fa/World-of-Weird-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/90/World-of-Weird-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/46/World-of-Weird-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f2/World-of-Weird-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/01/World-of-Weird-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/31/World-of-Weird-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f1/World-of-Weird-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/2d/World-of-Weird-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/ae/World-of-Weird-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/66/World-of-Weird-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/1f/World-of-Weird-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/4c/World-of-Weird-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 3203 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 47mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 1\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 1.04 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.standard.co.uk/stayingin/tvfilm/world-of-weird-channel-4-bronies-families-for-hire-and-a-man-with-39-wives-investigated-a2954246.html","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f475c61c63beeeca6fabf4a9ac941379083accca","amp;dn":"World+Of+Weird+720p+x264+AAC+HDTV+MVGroup.org","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f475c61c63beeeca6fabf4a9ac941379083accca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,117,198,28,99,190,238,202,111,171,244,169,172,148,19,121,8,58,204,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
