She quickly realises she can only begin to crack the murders and bring the culprit to justice with her former friends.  \n\nThe Bletchley Circle paints a vivid portrait of post-war Britain in this fictional tale of unsung heroes.\n\nStarring Anna Maxwell Martin, Rachael Stirling, Julie Graham, Sophie Rundle.\n\nNOTE: Excellent. Recommended.
