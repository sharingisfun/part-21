Everything else is just Ã¢â‚¬Å“evil surmisingsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ on his part 1 Timothy 6:4. Dr DiVietro and the DBS Executive Committee are todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Nicolaitans and differ only from Kutilek, White, Hudson, Hymers etc. in that they donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t adopt modern versions but prefer what is framed by themselves, and hammered on their anvil, as the Epistle Dedicatory says, using the Greek and the Hebrew so-called.\n\nIt is apparent therefore, as this author showed in an earlier work that Drs Waite, DiVietro and their fellow travellers are themselves the source of Ã¢â‚¬Ëœthe Greek etc.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ to which they demand that King James Bible believers meekly submit under pain of falling into error and false doctrine if they donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t.\nOrdinary Bible believers like this author are not about to bow down to that kind of Nicolaitan blackmail and tyranny.\n\nAlan O'Reilly's work Flotsam Flush reveals and rebukes the superficial, misleading and unscriptural nature of DiVietro's claims.\n\n\nAbout the author:\nAlan OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Reilly was born in Sydney, Australia and is a Chemical Engineer by training. Through the witness of The Navigators, he became a Christian while a student at the University of New South Wales in 1967. For the last 25 years, he has extensively investigated the text of the Authorised Version of the Bible. Covenant Publishers have made much of this research available in a 352-page book entitled Ã¢â‚¬Å“O BibliosÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Alan is a contender for the faith, believing that Ã¢â‚¬Å“all Scripture is given by inspiration of God,&quot; which has been preserved in the Authorized Version of the Holy Bible. His writings are a superb blend of the spiritual and the academic","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d808776c70d8c32a647961e9c768cdf5eabe6d79","amp;dn":"Flotsam+Flush+-+Alan+O%27Reilly","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d808776c70d8c32a647961e9c768cdf5eabe6d79","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,8,119,108,112,216,195,42,100,121,97,233,199,104,205,245,234,190,109,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
