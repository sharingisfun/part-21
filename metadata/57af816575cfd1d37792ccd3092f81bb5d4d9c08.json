In particular, one of the show&amp;#039;s segments entitled &quot;New Rules&quot; has struck a chord with viewers. It&amp;#039;s within his rules that Maher takes serious aim, bringing all his incisiveness, wit, and his signature exasperation to bear on topics ranging from cell phones (&quot;I don&amp;#039;t need my cell phone to take pictures or access the Internet. I just need to make a phone call. From everywhere! Not just the places it likes!&quot;) to fast food (&quot;New Rule: No more McDonald&amp;#039;s in hospitals. I&amp;#039;m not kidding!&quot;) to the conservative agenda (&quot;Stop claiming it&amp;#039;s an agenda. It&amp;#039;s not an agenda. It&amp;#039;s a random collection of laws that your corporate donors paid you to pass.&quot;), Maher brings these brilliantly conceived riffs to audio for the first time, along with some singularly Maher-ian &quot;editorials&quot;, editorials nothing like the standard fare found on the pages of the local newspaper!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:57af816575cfd1d37792ccd3092f81bb5d4d9c08","amp;dn":"Bill+Maher+-+New+Rules+From+A+Timid+Oberver+%28Audiobook%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"57af816575cfd1d37792ccd3092f81bb5d4d9c08","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,175,129,101,117,207,209,211,119,146,204,211,9,47,129,187,93,77,156,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
