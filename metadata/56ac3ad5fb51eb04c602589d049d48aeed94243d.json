Handy Award Winner Mel Brown proves to be the most authentic, real blues artist on the bill. Born in Jackson, Mississippi, Brown grew up in a family where playing music was as instinctive as breathing the Delta air. He has shared the stage with the greats, and has been both Bobby &quot;Blue&quot; Bland's and Albert Collins' regular guitarist. He relocated to Kitchener, Ontario, Canada for a steady gig in 1989, and has remained there ever since. Now Electro-Fi has re-released a completely repackaged version of his former independent live CD, Homewreckin' Done Live (Electro-Fi Records). Recorded in 1998 at Wally's Pub in Guelph, Ontario, this recording was previously only available off the bandstand. Now the whole world can enjoy this Mel Brown and Dave Ellerson produced 60-minute set.\n\nTracklist\n\n1. Woke Up This Morning 4:23 \n2. Fannie Mae 4:56 \n3. The Sky Is Crying 8:27 \n4.
