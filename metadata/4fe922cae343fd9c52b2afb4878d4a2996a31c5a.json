The tools I've included make the game easier to get into, but avoid changing any of the fundamentals - there are no mods here.  Dwarf Fortress can be confusing enough to play, but doesn't need to be hard to set up too.\n\n\nMD5: 37613D02AE9550D4B0DA6A780830B6F5\n\n\nChangelog 40_05 r2:\n\n - modified copy script; only draws from 40_05 saves (03+ is technically compatible, but graphics will break them; use manually at own risk)\n - updated ASCII default graphics, deleted ascii square; only difference was a single init option (use CLA for square ASCII)\n - updated Phoebus to 40_05v02\n - updated Mayday to 40_05\n - updated CLA to 40_05 (v17)\n - removed obsolete embark profiles, updated those with a clear successor for 40.xx\n - added CaptainDuck's beta embark profile (in tutorials set)\n - updated Spacefox, using Mayday's raw/objects update\n - patched d_init for Spacefox and Mayday; without setting [STRICT_POPULATION_CAP:x] you never get migrants\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4fe922cae343fd9c52b2afb4878d4a2996a31c5a","amp;dn":"Dwarf+Fortress+40_05+Starter+Pack+r2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4fe922cae343fd9c52b2afb4878d4a2996a31c5a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,233,34,202,227,67,253,156,82,178,175,180,135,141,74,41,150,163,28,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
