Great jumping-on point for new readers. One of the greatest horror franchises of all time returns, now under the control of its original creator! Clive Barker has touched HELLRAISER only twice: once to write THE HELLBOUND HEART, and once more to write and direct the original HELLRAISER film. Now witness Barkers long-awaited return to tell a new chapter in the series official continuity-a trajectory that will forever change the Cenobites...and Pinhead! Kirsty Cotton faces her greatest foes -- both new and old. And Pinhead is her greatest fear! But what could he have planned for her?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d6e42dce2e8b142042dcd5e288adad7c1fe798d","amp;dn":"Clive+Barkers+Hellraiser+%235.+Boom+comics+2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d6e42dce2e8b142042dcd5e288adad7c1fe798d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,110,66,220,226,232,177,66,4,45,205,94,40,138,218,215,193,254,121,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
