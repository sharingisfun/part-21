Traditional wooden boats were no longer necessary and as their use declined, so too did rowing.\r\n\r\nThat is until a couple of years ago, when the Scottish Coastal Rowing Project began with the arrival of a new kit boat called the St Ayles Skiff. Over forty different community groups have come together across Scotland to build their own skiff and then take part in one of the many regattas that have sprung up in their wake.\r\n\r\nWe take a look at the resurgence in coastal rowing throughout Scotland and follow one of the latest groups to get involved in Stornoway on the Isle of Lewis, on their journey to join the ranks.\r\n\r\nGaelic title: Ag iomradh 's a' tarraing.\r\n\r\nTechnical Spec\r\nVideo Codec: x265/HEVC CABAC   \r\nVideo Bitrate: CRF 20 (~1398Kbps)\r\nVideo Resolution: 832x468\r\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\nFrames Rate: 25 FPS\r\nAudio Codec: AAC-LC\r\nAudio Bitrate: Q=0.42 VBR 48KHz (~128Kbps)\r\nAudio Channels: 2 (Gaelic)\r\nRun-Time: 58 mins\r\nNumber Of Parts: 1\r\nPart Size: 643 MB\r\nSource: PDTV\r\nSubtitles: Embedded English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82677645644864d7aceb44d59a39410ea54cceb8","amp;dn":"Trusadh+Coastal+Rowing+PDTV+x265-MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82677645644864d7aceb44d59a39410ea54cceb8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,103,118,69,100,72,100,215,172,235,68,213,154,57,65,14,165,76,206,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
