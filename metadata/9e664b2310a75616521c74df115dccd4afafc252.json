They were all recorded at his 24 track &quot;home built&quot; basement studio. These same tracks were later used as audition tapes for the group BOSTON. When Tom Scholz and his band later signed with their current label, all of the songs were re-recorded for the first album. The differences between these demo versions and the final takes are sometimes subtle and sometimes obvious. For example, several songs have been now re-titled, with verses added and dropped. One song has never been released at all! The value of these recordings to the collector is obvious and we take great pride in presenting them. \n\nTrack Listing:\n\n1)Rock &amp; Roll Band\n\n2)Life Isn't Easy (Something About You)\n\n3)More Than A Feeling\n\n4)Don't Be Afraid Of Love\n\n5)Peace Of Mind\n\n6)San Francisco Day (Hitch A Ride)\n\nThe source for this torrent was vinyl to CD then ripped using Windows Media Player and then created the torrent using utorrent the sound quality isn't top notch but it's not horrible either.\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e664b2310a75616521c74df115dccd4afafc252","amp;dn":"The+Boston+Demo+Tapes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e664b2310a75616521c74df115dccd4afafc252","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,102,75,35,16,167,86,22,82,28,116,223,17,93,204,212,175,175,194,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
