This is his storyÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nMarcus Hardy had hoped to enjoy a year away at college while he put the summer heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d rather forget behind him. But instead, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s jerked right back to the coastal town of Sea Breeze, Alabama due to a family crisis. His dear ol' dad found himself a girlfriend only a few years older than Marcus. So now his sister needs help dealing with their mother who is mentally falling apart. The only bright spot to returning is the fascinating red head who sleeps over several times a week. The problem is she's sleeping in bed with his new roommate, Cage York. \n\nWillow Ã¢â‚¬Å“LowÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Foster needs a place to live. Running to CageÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s apartment every time her sister kicks her out isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t exactly a long term solution. Juggling her courses at the local community college and a part time job doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t produce excess income. But Cage has a new roommate and suddenly sleeping over at her best friendÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s apartment isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t such a bad thing. Not when she gets to see those sexy green eyes of Marcus HardyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s twinkle when he smiles at her like he wants her there. \nEven though Cage seems a little territorial where Low is concerned, Marcus finds time to spend with Low without upsetting his roommate. Cage may use his small college baseball star persona to sleep with every hot female in his path but heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s still under the disillusion that when heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s through sowing his wild oats, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s going to marry Low. Marcus intends to change that assumption for both Cage and Low. Until his carefully laid plans come crashing down with a revelation he never expected. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll have to choose between Low or his family. Because once the truth comes out.... thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no other choice.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4997b97e6070fe39746939f996c0532bf8f9ded5","amp;dn":"Because+of+Low","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4997b97e6070fe39746939f996c0532bf8f9ded5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,151,185,126,96,112,254,57,116,105,57,249,150,192,83,43,248,249,222,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
