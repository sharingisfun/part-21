Morally relevant properties entitle their possessors to have their\ninterests considered preferentially relative to those individuals who lack that\nproperty. Those dispensing consideration incur obligations or, minimally,\noptions, to act with bias. As a matter of fact, all known speciesists are human\nspeciesists, not in the sense that only humansÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and not tigers and cowsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nbelieve that species is a morally relevant attribute, but in the respect that they\nbelieve that human interests ought to be favored over the like interests of\nmembers of other species.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:175823af1a6e5c248d6650b2ba4e538703389c8b","amp;dn":"Neo-Speciesism+-+Article","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"175823af1a6e5c248d6650b2ba4e538703389c8b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,88,35,175,26,110,92,36,141,102,80,178,186,78,83,135,3,56,156,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
