Meet Mr. Lorre ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“a single, horribly selfish, man trying to survive on his own. A man who will leave behind every shred of his humanity to survive the Crossed. Now join us as Lapham and artist Raulo (Capt Swing) Caceres descend into a story about the worst aspects of human behavior, a tale of unspeakable evils, violent assaults on both mind and body, and of longing for death and the sweet release it will bring. Imagine, for a moment, the worst crimes against humanity. Picture the cruelest affronts to decency. Conjure your darkest nightmaresÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ and then realize it could all be so much worse. When civilization crumbles in one terrifying moment; when people are gleefully breaking into unthinkable acts of violence all around you; when everyone you love has died screaming in agony: What do you do? There is no help. There is no hope. There is no escape. There are only the Crossed.\n\n-- &gt;WARNING, includes very explicit and sadistic imagery. &lt;--","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1fd423a85b7862d23388a73f1f4f9d4ae724e5f2","amp;dn":"Crossed+-+Psychopath+Issue+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1fd423a85b7862d23388a73f1f4f9d4ae724e5f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,212,35,168,91,120,98,210,51,136,167,63,31,79,157,74,231,36,229,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
