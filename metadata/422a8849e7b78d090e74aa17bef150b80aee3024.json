Jimmy decided to put on his favorite album Barney's Greatest Hits, but turned his turntable on the wrong way and started playing it backwards. Fishman then proceeded to sing a verse of War Pigs. Trey subsequently teased I Love You before Harpua resumed. Poster was swallowed up into the earth by the Vibration of Death. &quot;The Vibration of Death is gone&quot; replaced the usual &quot;The storm is gone.&quot; A Pink Floyd Dark Side of the Moon tease (the heartbeats from Speak to Me) was pumped through the P.A. at the beginning of the second set. The second set &quot;musical costume&quot; was The Beatles' The Beatles (also known as The White Album). All of the White Album songs, other than Piggies, were Phish debuts, although Ob La Di, Ob La Da had been jammed or teased on many occasions. Piggies was played for the first time since 11/14/85 (876 shows). Birthday wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t sung; Page and Mike noodled a bit while Fishman presented a birthday cake to Brad Sands, who accepted it while wearing a Fishman dress. The background tape playing along with Revolution 9 was MikeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s composition He Ent to the Bog from PhishÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s White Tape. The song ended with Fishman stark naked and running around while the band blew bubbles and waved. Good Night was taped from the album and closed the second set.
