Rather, it is to present facts that are based on historically verified sources and then leave the reader to make his own decision, or if he desires, to investigate the matter further.\n\n\nIt is important not to judge the teachings of Islam\nbased upon the actions of some Muslims. Like every\nother community there are a few 'bad apples' and\nit is unfortunate that the media sometimes focuses on these \nindividuals in the Muslim community.\n\n    If you are seeking real Truth and Salvation like many \nothers before you, give Islam a try.\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d06c8f202e97c6b0969194f913cf61ffee54956","amp;dn":"A+Message+to+who+does+not+believe+in+Prophet+Muhammad+%28PBUH%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d06c8f202e97c6b0969194f913cf61ffee54956","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,6,200,242,2,233,124,107,9,105,25,79,145,60,246,31,254,229,73,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
