The extentive use of the violins played by Milena (leader and composer) gives the music its unique character. In 2005 first demo &quot;Silvae&quot; was released. With the arrival of new lead singer in 2006 the band re-recorded their demo together with two new songs. The classically trained singer Gosia together with the keyboard player Ania (ex-Sacriversum) gave the music a new bombastic and symphonic sound.\n\n\nArtist: At the Lake\nTitle: At the Lake\nYear: 2006\nLabel: Not on Label (At the Lake Self-released)\nCountry of Origin: Poland\nWebsite: http://www.atthelake.info/\n\nTracklist:\n1.
