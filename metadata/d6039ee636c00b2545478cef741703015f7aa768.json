Dubbed by some as &quot;Mad Max meets Bambi&quot;, it takes place in a mostly rural post-apocalyptic setting where some creatures are human/animal hybrids. \n\nAlthough the story is initially set in Nebraska, the landscape is inspired by Lemire's past home of Essex County.\nSweet Tooth, as a post-apocalyptic parable, is rife with influences such as Tim TrumanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Scout: War Shaman and the Winterworld three issue mini-series.[3] As well as art influence by Richard Corben's A Boy and His Dog written by Harlan Ellison and The Punisher: The End, written by Garth Ennis.\n\n\n\nOn May 7th 2012 Jeff Lemire announced that Sweet Tooth would be finishing with a double size special at #40.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n'Hailed by many as the finest comic they have ever read'\n\n                                       SEED &amp; ENJOY","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6039ee636c00b2545478cef741703015f7aa768","amp;dn":"Sweet+Tooth+%28Complete+Up-To-Date%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6039ee636c00b2545478cef741703015f7aa768","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,3,158,230,54,192,11,37,69,71,140,239,116,23,3,1,95,122,167,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
