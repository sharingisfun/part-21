Davidson (Springer, 2015).pdf\n\nISBN 978-3-319-14236-4\n\nThis book provides an overview of the field of flow and heat transfer in porous medium and focuses on presentation of a generalized approach to predict drag and convective heat transfer within porous medium of arbitrary microscopic geometry, including reticulated foams and packed beds. Practical numerical methods to solve natural convection problems in porous media will be presented with illustrative applications for filtrations, thermal storage and solar receivers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e747424fa47db7cc73dc0c934156bdba98af09f0","amp;dn":"Modeling+Approaches+to+Natural+Convection+in+Porous+Media","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e747424fa47db7cc73dc0c934156bdba98af09f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,71,66,79,164,125,183,204,115,220,12,147,65,86,189,186,152,175,9,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
