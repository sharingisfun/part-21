I did not do the art, but I care enough about accomplishing this goal that I have paid artists to do work for me.\n\nYou can view what the pages look like on Deviant Art.\n\nThe gallery's you'll want to check over are Growing Pains, Modern Hood &amp; The Legend Killer (Final version).\n\nModern Hood has been picked up by a publisher and is still in development.\n\nI own the rights to Growing Pains &amp; The Legend Killer.\n\nIf you're interested in supporting me financially. You can get a digital download of the full version of the books for .99 each at Drive Thru Comics.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://comics.drivethrustuff.com/index.php?manufacturers_id=4285&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://comics.drivethrustuff.com/index.php?manufacturers_id=4285&lt;/a&gt;\n\nHope you enjoy, thanks for looking.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:312c5fb0030c363582d04f31eab59c1ee827724a","amp;dn":"11-88+Studios+Comic+Pack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"312c5fb0030c363582d04f31eab59c1ee827724a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,44,95,176,3,12,54,53,130,208,79,49,234,181,156,30,232,39,114,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
