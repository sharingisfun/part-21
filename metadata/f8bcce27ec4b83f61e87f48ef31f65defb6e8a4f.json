Led by duel frontmen Dave Anthony (Guitar/Vocals) and Josh Knowles (Violin/Vocals), the band brings what Worcester Magazine calls ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œa nuclear power plant's worth of energyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ to any venue they enter. Energy isn't the only thing Nemes is focused on though. The band's songwriting, involving memorable lyrics and catchy hooks, will always be at the forefront, followed by a wide array of top-notch musicianship.\n\nSince being named one of Alternative Press' top 5 unsigned bands in 2010, Nemes has embarked on two tours of the Eastern US, continued building a local fanbase, and most recently released a full length album. The album is entitled ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDon't Flush MeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and showcases the many sides that Nemes has to offer. On the disc, the band seamlessly transitions from arena-sized rock songs to violin-plucking tunes with just as much emotional intensity.\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8bcce27ec4b83f61e87f48ef31f65defb6e8a4f","amp;dn":"Nemes+-+Don%5C%27t+Flush+Me+-+2011+320k+mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f8bcce27ec4b83f61e87f48ef31f65defb6e8a4f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,188,206,39,236,75,131,246,30,135,244,142,243,31,101,222,251,110,138,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
