But how do they explore the digital world? Ayah Bdeir applied her engineering background to these &quot;problems of play&quot; and came up with a new kind of toy: littleBits. littleBits make electronics, light, sound, and sensors as easy to play with as LEGOs and Lincoln LogsÃ¢â‚¬â€combining learning, prototyping, and fun. In this Creative Insights interview, Ayah explains how she created littleBits, grew the toy into a full-fledged company, and learned to accept fame and funding on her own terms.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a0ac8dac736f0dbabd502cf799cc93236d187cb8","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+Creative+Insights%3A+Ayah+Bdeir+and+littleBits","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a0ac8dac736f0dbabd502cf799cc93236d187cb8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,172,141,172,115,111,13,186,189,80,44,247,153,204,147,35,109,24,124,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
