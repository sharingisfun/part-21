Bintley shows how the then Sadler's Wells Ballet Company, led by Ninette de Valois and featuring a star-studded generation of British dancers and choreographers including Margot Fonteyn and Frederick Ashton, was forged during the Second World War.\n\nIt's the story of how de Valois and her small company of dancers took what was essentially a foreign art form and made it British despite the falling bombs, the rationing and the call-up. Plus, it is the story of how Britain, as a nation, fell in love with ballet.\n\nUsing rare and previously unseen footage and interviews with dance icons such as Dame Gillian Lynne and Dame Beryl Grey, Bintley shows how the Sadler's Wells Ballet company survived an encounter with Nazi forces in Holland, dancing whilst the bombs were falling in the Blitz, rationing and a punishing touring schedule to bring ballet to the British people as an antidote to the austerity the country faced to emerge postwar as The Royal Ballet.\n\nTechnical Spec\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;dc94b5bbb49c90e8f2ed&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script data-cfhash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;data-cfhash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}t.parentNode.removeChild(t);}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nVideo Bitrate: CRF 19 (~2711Kbps)\nVideo Resolution: 1280x720\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\nFrame Rate: 25 FPS\nAudio Codec: AAC-LC\nAudio Bitrate: Q=0.47 VBR 48KHz (~128Kbps)\nAudio Channels: 2\nRun-Time: 59 mins\nNumber of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 1.20 GB\nSource: HDTV\nSubtitles: Merged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9db452db72029121c654eb241229cde9151971c","amp;dn":"BBC.Dancing.in.the.Blitz.720p.HDTV.x264-MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9db452db72029121c654eb241229cde9151971c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,219,69,45,183,32,41,18,28,101,78,178,65,34,156,222,145,81,151,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
