A terrible secret discovered in a ruined city. Earth is no longer ruled by humans, but by the species they uplifted. Creatures called fleshdogs are their emissaries, and humanity must fight this implacable enemy or face extinction. Balzac must confront monsters and more trying to find his lover. And when he does find her, will the price be too great? This novella is part of Jeff VanderMeerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cycle of far-future stories, which culminated with the critically acclaimed novel Veniss Underground. As an added bonus, this e-book also includes two extras: an incomplete story set during the same time period as Ã¢â‚¬Å“BalzacÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s WarÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and VanderMeerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s original afterword to the UK edition of Veniss Underground, shedding light on the original creator of the creatures that take center stage in Ã¢â‚¬Å“BalzacÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s War.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ff68189ce049d51de1507e2b58a7ecb4ed41f95","amp;dn":"Balzac%27s+War+-+Jeff+VanderMeer.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ff68189ce049d51de1507e2b58a7ecb4ed41f95","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,246,129,137,206,4,157,81,222,21,7,226,181,138,126,203,78,212,31,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
