He visits them once or twice a year, mainly to give them a chance to spend a few days with their grandson. His hopes of spending a quiet weekend with the family fall short when Gitte, who has been mentally unstable since Marko was a child, feels so healthy after a homeopathic treatment that she stops taking her medication. Her announcement triggers reserved reactions in the family, and a series of revelations tip his family's structure out of balance.\n\n\nSubs srt: Portuguese / English / Dutch","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a0fdb30b0237af9fab587b11df84f253a1c39df","amp;dn":"Was+Bleibt+aka+Home+For+The+Weekend+2012+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a0fdb30b0237af9fab587b11df84f253a1c39df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,15,219,48,176,35,122,249,250,181,135,177,29,248,79,37,58,28,57,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
