Karmakar et al. (Springer, 2007).pdf\r\n\r\nIn recent years submicron and nanoscale systems have featured strongly on the research agenda due to the technological progress and new physics that have emerged from studies of ultra-small systems. A fundamental understanding of basic physical phenomena on the mesoscopic and nanoscopic scales is required to exploit the technological potential offered by these exotic materials. The present book contains review-like chapters by some of the leading experts in the field, covering topics such as the Kondo effect, electron transport, disorder and quantum coherence with electron-electron interaction, persistent current, thermoelectric phenomena, etc. in quantum dots, quantum wires, carbon nanotubes and more. This book will be valuable to researchers and students in condensed matter physics","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e91476d8c7f34b15f1bdb27dca7d27043ec703af","amp;dn":"Physics+of+Zero+and+One+Dimensional+Nanoscopic+Systems","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e91476d8c7f34b15f1bdb27dca7d27043ec703af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,20,118,216,199,243,75,21,241,189,178,125,202,125,39,4,62,199,3,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
