Juxtaposing the stilt performers' whimsical, absurdist fantasies with the moribund immediacy of ÃƒÆ’Ã‚ï¿½ngel's melancholy and isolation, the film becomes a lucid parable for the human imperative to reconnect with its own collective soul in the wake of profound tragedy - a metaphoric shedding of aloof and distancing escapist stilts that inevitably becomes a symbol for ÃƒÆ’Ã‚ï¿½ngel's own figurative return to the process of life on earth - a spiritual re-engagement with the travails and rapture of an imperfect, but redemptive but existence.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088443/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088443/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSpanish audio; English subtitles\n\nCarlos Saura - Los zancos (1984)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e665449b012ffd47b77e761a62d27ead1990f369","amp;dn":"Carlos+Saura+-+Los+zancos+%281984%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e665449b012ffd47b77e761a62d27ead1990f369","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,101,68,155,1,47,253,71,183,126,118,26,98,210,126,173,25,144,243,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
