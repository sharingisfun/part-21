I'm Casey Kasem and this is American Top 40.&quot;\n\n\nAmerican Top 40 with Casey Kasem aired on radio from July 4, 1970 until August 6, 1988. This is American Top 40's year end countdown for 1981 and was originally broadcast in two parts, on December 26th, 1981 and January 2nd, 1982. \n\nIn this countdown 77 songs feature male vocals, 45 songs are by groups or duos, 42 songs are by male soloists, and 28 songs are by foreign acts.\n\nThere are 17 number one hits (three by women), 15 songs are by newcomers, there are 13 English acts, 13 hits by women, 8 remakes, and 3 trios (2 all-male, one all-female).\n\nFive acts have more than two hits, there are 12 country songs, and 3 songs by the late and beloved John Lennon.\n\nThere is only one act with 4 hits, only 1 hit from a Canadian artist (but we all still love Canada), and one television show theme song.\n\nYou'll hear the talent of a man who put 4 songs off his first album into the top 40, something never done before.\n\nThere is a song that, as of 1981, held the record for most weeks spent at the number 3 position.\n\nYou'll hear hits from a woman who has had five number one albums, more than any other female act.\n\nAlso, as Casey introduces &quot;Guilty&quot; (by Barbra Streisand And Barry Gibb at number 35) he mentions the song at number 92 (&quot;What Kind Of Fool&quot; also by Barbra Streisand &amp; Barry Gibb), but says it is at number 52.\n\n100: Time Is Time - Andy Gibb\n99: Share Your Love With Me - Kenny Rogers\n98: Super Freak - Rick James\n97: Never Be The Same - Christopher Cross\n96: Her Town Too - James Taylor &amp; J.D.
