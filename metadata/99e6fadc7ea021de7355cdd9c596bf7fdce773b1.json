The elder Renoir is filled with a new, wholly unexpected energy when a young girl miraculously enters his world. Blazing with life, radiantly beautiful, AndrÃƒÂ©e will become his last model, and the wellspring of a remarkable rejuvenation. At the same time, Jean also falls under the spell of the free-spirited young AndrÃƒÂ©e. Their beautiful home and majestic countryside grounds reverberate with familial intrigue, as both Renoirs, pÃƒÂ¨re et fils, become smitten with the enchanting and headstrong young muse.\n\n\nLanguages: French / Italian\n\nsubs srt: Portuguese / English / Spanish","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:99e6fadc7ea021de7355cdd9c596bf7fdce773b1","amp;dn":"Renoir+2012+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"99e6fadc7ea021de7355cdd9c596bf7fdce773b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,230,250,220,126,160,33,222,115,85,205,217,197,150,191,127,220,231,115,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
