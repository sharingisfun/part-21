All my scripts are.\n\nFrom Empire magazine&amp;#039;s January 2008 issue as part of a 13 page Coen brothers feature; &quot;Going into production next April (2009), little has been revealed about this comedy. Rumour has it as the story of a Jewish professor in the 1960&amp;#039;s who starts to question the value of his life. He wants a divorce from his philandering wife, to stop his children taking all his money and to be rid of his deadbeat brother. Not only that, he is now receiving death threat letters from a mystery source, and his hot neighbour keeps sunbathing nude. The cast has not yet been announced, but various rumours have Jennifer Anniston, Colin Firth and Sir Ben Kingsley to feature.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2da7a6bf88b74fd9c128adb7d0a718386b0fd653","amp;dn":"A.Serious.Man.Coen.Bros.Script","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2da7a6bf88b74fd9c128adb7d0a718386b0fd653","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,167,166,191,136,183,79,217,193,40,173,183,208,167,24,56,107,15,214,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
