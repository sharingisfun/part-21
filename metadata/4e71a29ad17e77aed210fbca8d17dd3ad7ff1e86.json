Koerner, &quot;The Skies Belong to Us: Love and Terror in the Golden Age of Hijacking&quot;\nISBN: 0307886107 | 2013 | EPUB\n\nIn an America torn apart by the Vietnam War and the demise of sixties idealism, airplane hijackings were astonishingly routine. Over a five-year period starting in 1968, the desperate and disillusioned seized commercial jets nearly once a week, using guns, bombs, and jars of acid. Some hijackers wished to escape to foreign lands, where they imagined being hailed as heroes; others aimed to swap hostages for sacks of cash. Their criminal exploits mesmerized the country, never more so than when the young lovers at the heart of Brendan I. KoernerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s The Skies Belong to Us pulled off the longest-distance hijacking in American history.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e71a29ad17e77aed210fbca8d17dd3ad7ff1e86","amp;dn":"The+Skies+Belong+to+Us%3A+Love+and+Terror+in+the+Age+of+Hijacking","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e71a29ad17e77aed210fbca8d17dd3ad7ff1e86","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,113,162,154,209,126,119,174,210,16,251,202,141,23,221,58,215,255,30,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
