I have no idea why. I think it was added by Extremezone.\n\nAnyhow in this torrent You have manual and readme.txt file that will explain You everything. It works lika a harm for me :) Just mount the .iso file on virtual drive and explore main catalogue. \n\n\n\nWhy am I adding this game again? Because this is THE ONLY space sim, in which You can LAND ON A PLANETS !!! Yes !!! You fly through the planets atmosphere and have to maneuvere very carefully when sitting the craft on the ground.\n\n\nMore info here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.1cpublishing.eu/game/the-tomorrow-war/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.1cpublishing.eu/game/the-tomorrow-war/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\nI don't have public IP right now, so please seed if You can!\n\nThank You!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40137a2e4efe3d8a2e28430a68bf6e51b30a67d0","amp;dn":"The.Tomorrow.War-SKIDROW","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40137a2e4efe3d8a2e28430a68bf6e51b30a67d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,19,122,46,78,254,61,138,46,40,67,10,104,191,110,81,179,10,103,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
