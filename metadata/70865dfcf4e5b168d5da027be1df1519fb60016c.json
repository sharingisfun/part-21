But, behind the Hollywood image, some of the most fascinating tales of buccaneers come not from the silver screen, but real life. In Wicked Pirate City you will experience the original home of the real-life Pirates of the Caribbean.\n\nWith frequent raids on the surrounding islands by the likes of legendary UK born privateer Henry Morgan - it wasn't known as the 'the world's wickedest city' for nothing. But, in 1692, a catastrophic earthquake caused the entire city to sink into the sea, killing thousands and submerging a treasure trove of archaeological gems.\nNow, a team of marine scientists ventures beneath the waves to explore the sunken remains of this fascinating ghost town.\n\nThey hope to piece together life in the city like never before, opening a window onto the lives of the murderers, thieves and prostitutes who made it their home.\nBy analysing the remains of the city in detail, the team also hopes to create an ambitious CGI model of Port Royal in its bustling heyday.\nAs they dig deep into the murky past, this is an intimate portrait of one of history's most infamous cities.\n\n\n\n\nNarrated by: Bill Graves \n========================\n\n\nProduced by: Elliott Halpern\n============================\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle................:    Wicked Pirate City\nYear.................:    2011\nGenre................:    Documentary \nVideo Length.........:    01:29:57\n\n\nAudio Bitrate........:    192 kbit/s\nAudio Codec..........:    (AC3)\nLanguage.............:    English        \nDisplay Aspect ratio.:    16/9\n\nVideo Codec..........:    XviD \nVideo Resolution.....:    624x352\nVIdeo Bitrate........:    2008 kbit/s\n\n\nSubs.................:    (N/A) \nFile Size:...........:    1.26 GB\nFPS..................:    29.970000\n\nChannel(s)...........:    2 channels\nRelease date.........:    2011\n\n\n\n\n\n   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt2047915/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt2047915/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\n\nFor further information and pictures/images of all my torrents visit\\\\\\&quot; Suprbay Forum\\\\\\&quot; at \nthis link: &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&lt;/a&gt;                 \n\n*** This information is also avaible on the \\\\\\&quot;nfo\\\\\\&quot; file that comes with all my uploads.)***   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            *** RECOMMENDED DOWNLOAD ***\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:70865dfcf4e5b168d5da027be1df1519fb60016c","amp;dn":"Wicked+Pirate+City-%28WTC-SWE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"70865dfcf4e5b168d5da027be1df1519fb60016c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,134,93,252,244,229,177,104,213,218,2,123,225,223,21,25,251,96,1,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
