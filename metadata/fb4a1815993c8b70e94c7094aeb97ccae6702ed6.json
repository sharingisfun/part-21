Melanie Stryder (Saoirse Ronan), a human, is captured by the Seeker (Diane Kruger) and infused with a soul called &quot;Wanderer&quot;, in order to discover the location of one of the last pockets of non-assimilated humans. However, Melanie survives the procedure and begins to struggle for control of her body.\n\nWanderer discovers that Melanie was captured while scavenging for food with her brother Jamie Stryder (Chandler Canterbury) and her boyfriend Jared Howe (Max Irons), and that they were looking for Melanie's uncle Jeb Stryder (William Hurt), who lives in a cabin in the desert. Wanderer loses control of Melanie and the Seeker decides to put Wanderer in a different body and be insterted into Melanie to get the information herself. With the help of Melanie, Wanderer escapes and makes her way to the desert, eventually found by a group of humans, including Jeb. She is taken to a series of underground caves, discovering that Jared and Jamie are living there too.\n\nWanderer is kept isolated from the others, eventually interacting with the humans, and develops feelings for one of them, Ian O'Shea (Jake Abel), beginning to believe the Souls shouldn't steal other people's free will. Eventually, Jeb, Jamie and Ian realize Melanie is still alive, while The Seeker learns that the community is located somewhere in the desert and follows Wanderer there, but fails to locate them. After nearly being captured by the Seeker, Ian's brother Kyle O'Shea (Boyd Holbrook) attempts to kill Wanderer, but is stopped by Ian and another human, Wes, after which Jared also learns that Melanie is still alive.\n\n\n\n* enjoy ...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb4a1815993c8b70e94c7094aeb97ccae6702ed6","amp;dn":"The+Host.flv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb4a1815993c8b70e94c7094aeb97ccae6702ed6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,74,24,21,153,60,139,112,233,76,112,148,174,185,124,202,230,112,46,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
