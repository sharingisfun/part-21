It is the basic emotional civilization and its mechanistic-mystical conception of life.&quot;ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Wilhelm Reich\n\nResponsibility for the elimination of fascism thus results with the masses of average people who might otherwise support and champion it.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Mass-Psychology-Fascism-Wilhelm-Reich/dp/0374508844/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1236111052&amp;sr=8-1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Mass-Psychology-Fascism-Wilhelm-Reich/dp/0374508844/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1236111052&amp;sr=8-1&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d765bcde53fb98bc47c0c679984e6518b8fe4328","amp;dn":"The+Mass+Psychology+of+Fascism+-+Reich.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d765bcde53fb98bc47c0c679984e6518b8fe4328","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,101,188,222,83,251,152,188,71,192,198,121,152,78,101,24,184,254,67,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
