It looks like the entire string section of the Berlin Philharmonic (a very big orchestra) were involved here.\n\nMany Baroque &quot;purists&quot; will dislike this recording for the reason mentioned above, but I enjoyed it immensely. This is Vivaldi with power, passion and romance - the summer thunderstorm really sounds like a storm instead of a mild shower.\n\n\nVivaldi The Four Seasons\nViolin: Anne-Sophie Mutter\nBerliner Philharmoniker\nConductor: Herbert von Karajan\n\n\nThe video was ripped/encoded into Xvid using DVDDecrypter/AutoGK\nThe audio was ripped into AC3 using AutoGK\nThe video is 48mins long and is 1434 Kbps, 25.0 fps, res. 448*336 (4:3)\nThe size of the video is 650megs.\n\nYou'll need the AC3 filter on your computer to hear this","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40573abf9d3525ebef4b7dfae13a84d31a759d7b","amp;dn":"Vivaldi+-+The+Four+Seasons+-+Karajan+and+Mutter","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40573abf9d3525ebef4b7dfae13a84d31a759d7b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,87,58,191,157,53,37,235,239,75,125,250,225,58,132,211,26,117,157,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
