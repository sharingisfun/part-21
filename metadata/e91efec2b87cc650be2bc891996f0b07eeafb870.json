The show opens with Metheny playing solo stuff, mostly tracks from One Quiet Night (2003) on his Nashville-tuned barytone guitar, and Into the Dream on his Pikasso 42-string. The latter part of the show is played in the trio-format, showcasing Methenys latest trio in a somewhat differemt context than the Day Trip and Tokyo Day Trip EP. \n\nThe original recording equipment is probably a stereo mic in the audience, which captured a surprisingly rich recording of the show, albeit with some pretty ugly dynamics (e.g. audience clapping louder than both acoustic and electric sets). \n\nI have done some manual EQ-ing and compressing of the different tracks, balancing the music and the audience. In addition I've ran the recordings through an EQ, a subtle master compressor and limiter,  trying to keep the feeling and dynamic width from the show, but making the tracks a bit more playable in a home stereo/headphone playback-situation.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e91efec2b87cc650be2bc891996f0b07eeafb870","amp;dn":"Metheny%2C+McBride%2C+Sanchez+-+live+at+Rams+Head+2003+%28remaster%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e91efec2b87cc650be2bc891996f0b07eeafb870","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,30,254,194,184,124,198,80,190,43,200,145,153,111,11,7,238,175,184,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
