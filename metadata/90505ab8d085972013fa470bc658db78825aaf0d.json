He whisks them away to his secluded old castle, where he wines and dines them (among other things, *wink*). With the aid of his bald mute little helper Gorgo, he kills his dates, keeping their heads in a crystal cage and feeding their chopped up body parts to his 1,000-strong army of blood thirty, flesh hungry cats.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90505ab8d085972013fa470bc658db78825aaf0d","amp;dn":"Night+Of+A+Thousand+Cats+1972+XviD+DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90505ab8d085972013fa470bc658db78825aaf0d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,80,90,184,208,133,151,32,19,250,71,11,198,88,219,120,130,90,175,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
