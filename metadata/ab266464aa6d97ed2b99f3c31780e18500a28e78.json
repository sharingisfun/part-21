Ã¢â‚¬Å“Somewhere In My HeartÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ was the first single to crack the all-important Top Ten, reaching # 3, and Frame found himself the property of the Smash Hits generation, while the album reached # 10 and stayed in the charts for 43 weeks. \n\nAlso included are the singles Ã¢â‚¬Å“How Men AreÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Deep &amp; Wide &amp; TallÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.
