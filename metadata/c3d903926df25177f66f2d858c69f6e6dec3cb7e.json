The number used in the title is now a telephone number for a driving school in Scotland but at the time GUN used it, was a number you could call to hear band members give out news on the band and leave messages for them. \nThe album was quite successful, reaching 32 in the UK. Crazy You and My Sweet Jane were also moderate chart hits.\n\nMP3 - 320kbs\n\n    &quot;Rescue You&quot;\n    &quot;Crazy You&quot;\n    &quot;Seventeen&quot;\n    &quot;All My Love&quot;\n    &quot;My Sweet Jane&quot;\n    &quot;Come A Long Way&quot;\n    &quot;All I Ever Wanted&quot;\n    &quot;I Don't Mind&quot;\n    &quot;Going Down&quot;\n    &quot;Always Friends&quot;\n\n\nPlease Dont Hit And Run !\n\nAnd Please Feel free to Comment, Reguest and tell me what you like :D","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3d903926df25177f66f2d858c69f6e6dec3cb7e","amp;dn":"Gun+-+%281997%29+0141+632+6326+%5B320kbs%5D+%7E%7ERenovatio%7E%7E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3d903926df25177f66f2d858c69f6e6dec3cb7e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,217,3,146,109,242,81,119,246,111,45,133,140,105,246,230,222,195,203,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
