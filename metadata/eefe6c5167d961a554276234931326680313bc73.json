As it's a musical, I encoded the audio at 160kbps VBR.\n \n - To use the subtitles, simply extract the .SUB file from the .RAR archive into the same folder. A free app. that will extract .RAR archives is 7-Zip from http://www.7-zip.org/\n \n - I seed using &quot;Initial Seeding&quot; which means that the torrent may show zero seeds; disregard this as I will seed for several days until there are other seeds.\n\n - Please make sure to seed as my upstream is rather slow (256kbps.) Small-scale torrents of hard-to-find large files such as rare movies are more vulnerable to dying if everyone doesn't seed to 100% or higher. Please do your part so free media will always be available. If everyone seeded to 101%, no torrent would ever die.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eefe6c5167d961a554276234931326680313bc73","amp;dn":"Alexander%5C%27s+Ragtime+Band+%281938%29.DVDRip.XviD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eefe6c5167d961a554276234931326680313bc73","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,254,108,81,103,217,97,165,84,39,98,52,147,19,38,104,3,19,188,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
