As rambam1776 notes, &quot;This is the best avi rip currently available of the film. Its quality is equal to that of the commercial DVD, which unfortunately did not contain a high quality print, subtitles, or even the original trailer. Here's hoping that someday someone releases a superior commercial copy.&quot;\n\nThe subtitles in the subtitle track are new.\n\nThe new subtitles also are available for download as a srt file from opensubtitles dot org (#5735671). This is for the benefit of anyone who would like to use the subtitles with rambam1776's avi version of the movie.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2fdb70e48de5d0646686637db1f398a79cfb0940","amp;dn":"Road+to+Rio+1947+600x456+mkv+%5BPeerless%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2fdb70e48de5d0646686637db1f398a79cfb0940","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,219,112,228,141,229,208,100,102,134,99,125,177,243,152,167,156,251,9,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
