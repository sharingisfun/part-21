They are in 3 volumes with 5 one hour DVDs in each volume. Each volume was recorded in a different city.\n\nThe Art Of Allowing, Vol I &quot;San Francisco, CA&quot; (DVDs 1-5)\nThe Art Of Allowing, Vol II &quot;Monterey, CA&quot; (DVDs 6-10)\nThe Art Of Allowing, Vol III &quot;San Rafael, CA&quot; (DVDs 11-15) \n\n\nTopics Included in DVD 5:\nDreams and out-of-body-experiences. \nYour triad of intentions. \nWhatever happened, your work now is to let it in. \nKnow that all of your desires are in the process of being answered. \nHow contrast manifests. \nThe mantra of the universe is &quot;Now what?&quot; \nThe art of allowing is in feeling good about what you want.\n\n\nAbraham, Jerry &amp; Esther Hicks   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.abraham-hicks.com/lawofattractionsource/index.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.abraham-hicks.com/lawofattractionsource/index.php&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIn 1985, Jerry and Esther Hicks began dialogs with Abraham. Abraham is a name. A symbol. A feeling. But who, or what, is/are, Abraham . . . really? \n\nAbraham is a Non-Physical entity - whom Esther calls &quot;infinite intelligence&quot; and Jerry refers to as &quot;the purest form of love I've ever encountered.&quot; \nLouise Hay calls them &quot;some of the best teachers on the planet today.&quot; \n\nTo Dr. Wayne Dyer they are &quot;the great Masters of the Universe!&quot; \n\nThe Teachings of Abraham are based on a universal principle called the Law of Attraction and on the key role our emotions play, and they illuminate and inform every aspect of our experience. \n\nAbraham, a group of obviously evolved teachers, speak their broader Non-physical perspective through the physical apparatus of Esther. Speaking to our level of comprehension, from their present moment to our now, through a series of loving, allowing, brilliant yet comprehensively simple, recordings in print and in sound -- they guide us to a clear connection with our Inner Being -- they guide us to self-upliftment from our total self. \n\nCheck out Abraham for yourself. It's the only way to go and the only way to know. \n\nAnd finally-from Jerry-&quot;Mr. Practical&quot;: \n\n&quot;I don't know what they are and I don't care what they are. I'm just using them for the good it will do for myself and others.&quot;\n\n\nJerry and Esther deliver an inspirational message of joy and well-being. They travel to over forty cities every year, offering workshops where participants direct their questions to Abraham and learn ways to achieve all that is desired in life.  \n\n&quot;The Teachings of Abraham&quot; is the original source material for the current Law of Attraction wave that is sweeping the world, and it is the 21st century inspiration for thousands of books, films, essays and lectures that are responsible for the current paradigm shift in consciousness. \n\nHere at www.abraham-hicks.com you will find accurate clarification of the basics of the Law of Attraction and practical applications as well as up-to-the-moment leading-edge expanding information regarding the Law of Attraction. (Also known as &quot;The Teachings of Abraham&quot;) This is the fountainhead of the information upon which the hit movie, &quot;The Secret&quot; was based.\n\nLaw of Attraction says, &quot;That which is like unto itself is drawn.&quot; Everything is valid and everything is truthful, because Law of Attraction lets everything be. The thrill of the ride is carved out of the contrast. Without the contrast, you could not decide.\n\nThank you to all who participated to make this possible!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e32ae73c0c90059eb9533fd1ac97a844b6d9d72","amp;dn":"Abraham-Hicks+2000-08-26+DVD+05+of+15+Art+of+Allowing+Series","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e32ae73c0c90059eb9533fd1ac97a844b6d9d72","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,50,174,115,192,201,0,89,235,149,51,253,26,201,122,132,75,109,157,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
