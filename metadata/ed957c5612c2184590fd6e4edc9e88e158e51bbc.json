With chapters like \\&quot;No. We do not have any `hot stock tips\\' for you,\\&quot; \\&quot;Mergers are a girl\\'s best friend,\\&quot; and \\&quot;Georgetown? I wouldn\\'t let my maids\\' kids go there,\\&quot; the book captures the true essence of being in high finance.\n\nDIFGTBAB thematically walks through Wall Street culture, pointing out its intricacies: the bushleagueness of a Men\\'s Warehouse suit or squared-toe shoes, the power of 80s pop, and the importance of Microsoft Excel shortcut keys as related to ever being able to have any significant global impact.\n\nThe book features various, vivid illustrations of Bankers in their natural state (ballin\\'), and, in true Book 2.0 fashion, numerous, insightful comments from actual readers of the widely popular website LeveragedSellOut.com.\n\nThorough and well-executed, it\\'s lens into the heart of an often misunderstood, unfairly stereotyped subset of our society. The view--breathtaking.
