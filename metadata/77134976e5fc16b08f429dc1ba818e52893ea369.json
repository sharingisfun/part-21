However, some fans might not even be able to recognize the deep lyrics disguised by the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s upbeat sound. \n\nWatch Typhoon rock out at XPNÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Free at Noon and open for indie-rock band Okkervil River at the Union Transfer that night at 7:30 p.m. Ticket Information Available \n\n\nPLEASE BUY THEIR CD\n\nRecent Release: White Lighter\nRelease Date: August 20, 2013\nLabel: Roll Call Records\n\nthe video comes later","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:77134976e5fc16b08f429dc1ba818e52893ea369","amp;dn":"Typhoon+live+at+World+Cafe+Live+Philadelphia+Pa+USA+March+28+201","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"77134976e5fc16b08f429dc1ba818e52893ea369","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,19,73,118,229,252,22,176,143,66,157,193,186,129,142,82,137,62,163,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
