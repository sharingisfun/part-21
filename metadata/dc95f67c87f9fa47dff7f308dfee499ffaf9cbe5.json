Deriving their name from the bands Strawberry Switchblade and Meat Whiplash, the duo formulated a sweet, reverb-kissed sound that nodded to acts like Tiger Trap, Heavenly, and Black Tambourine.\nItÃƒâ€ s strange to think that Hits in the Car is truly the debut record for Strawberry Whiplash. Regardless, this collection of thirteen great pop tunes is pretty spot-on for a debut, going between infectious indie pop and noisy janglings; its all worth every minute of timeÃƒÂ \n\nTrack Listing:\n\n01.
