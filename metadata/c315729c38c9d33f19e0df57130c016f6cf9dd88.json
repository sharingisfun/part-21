Here, Lord Mountbatten narrates his life story using a wealth of historical material from the archives of the world - including much from his own personal collection. This extraordinary 12 episode series spans 70 years of triumph, conflict and glory in the life of this remarkable man who rose to worldwide recognition as both statesman and military hero, yet was tragically assassinated in 1979. It is this tremendous sweep of international events and changes that has been recaptured in ths unique series. Unique because it is not only about, but with the man concerned. The production team, including Lord Mountbatten, revisited many of the locales in which his career was formed - Malta, Burma, Ceylon, Singapore, India. Excerpts have been incuded from many of those whose lives and duties infuenced those of Lord Mountbatten, or were influenced by him. They include the Duke of Windsor, Prince Philip, six former Prime Ministers, General Eisenhower and other key figures in world history. \n\nA Television History by John Terraine\nProduced and Directed by Peter Morley\nNarration spoken by Alec Mango\nA Rediffusion Television Production\n\n\n\n\n4)  The Stormy Winds \nThe years 1936-1941.\n\nA bad time for Mountbatten as for others: the death of George V; the abdication of Edward VIII; the war in Spain; the Japanese invasion of China; the failure of the League of Nations; the policy of appeasement leading to the resignation of the First Lord of the Admiralty and of the Foreign Secretary (Mountbatten was also not in favour); the death of Mountbatten's brother George, the Marquis of Milford Haven; the German and French mobilisation; the dispute over the control of the Fleet Air Arm, which the Navy eventually wins. Mountbatten becomes captain in command of the 5th destroyer flotilla in June 1939, taking command of HMS Kelly. Filmed at the Kelly reunion dinner in 1966, he describes the torpedoing of Kelly and the successful attempt to tow her back to harbour during the April 1940 raid on Norway, and her subsequent sinking after complete refitting in May 1941 in the evacuation of Crete.\n\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img690.imageshack.us/img690/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img690.imageshack.us/img690/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img507.imageshack.us/img507/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img507.imageshack.us/img507/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img689.imageshack.us/img689/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img689.imageshack.us/img689/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img221.imageshack.us/img221/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img221.imageshack.us/img221/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img24.imageshack.us/img24/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img24.imageshack.us/img24/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img197.imageshack.us/img197/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img197.imageshack.us/img197/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img545.imageshack.us/img545/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img545.imageshack.us/img545/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img834.imageshack.us/img834/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img834.imageshack.us/img834/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img10.imageshack.us/img10/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img10.imageshack.us/img10/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img713.imageshack.us/img713/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img713.imageshack.us/img713/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img9.imageshack.us/img9/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img9.imageshack.us/img9/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img593.imageshack.us/img593/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img593.imageshack.us/img593/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img109.imageshack.us/img109/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img109.imageshack.us/img109/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img42.imageshack.us/img42/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img42.imageshack.us/img42/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img24.imageshack.us/img24/8505/thelifeandtimesoflordmoo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img24.imageshack.us/img24/8505/thelifeandtimesoflordmoo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img69.imageshack.us/img69/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img69.imageshack.us/img69/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 1987 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 704x528\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 29.970\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 224kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: english\nRunTime Per Part: 49:25.592\nNumber Of Parts: 12\nPart Size: 785 MB\nRipped by: DocFreak08\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c315729c38c9d33f19e0df57130c016f6cf9dd88","amp;dn":"Thames+Television+The+Life+and+Times+of+Lord+Mountbatten+04of12+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c315729c38c9d33f19e0df57130c016f6cf9dd88","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,21,114,156,56,201,211,63,25,224,223,87,19,12,1,111,108,249,221,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
