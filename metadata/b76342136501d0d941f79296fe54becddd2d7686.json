As previously reported, the group paid tribute to Jimi Hendrix during the show, focusing on material they have never performed live. GovÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Mule covers a particular musician or bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s catalog every Halloween but they chose Hendrix this year in order to coincide with what would have been the guitaristÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 70th birthday. The groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s past Halloween shows have paid tribute to Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, The Rolling Stones and The Who.\n\nAfter playing a set of their own material, GovÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Mule took the stage during their second set while a vintage Hendrix interview was played for the crowd. Then, they launched into Ã¢â‚¬Å“EXP,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the opening track from Axis: Bold as Love and proceeded to offer a mix of tracks from all three of the Jimi Hendrix ExperienceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s studio albums, among other Hendrix classics. As promised, the group debuted a slew of material throughout the night, including Ã¢â‚¬Å“EXP,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Freedom One Rainy Wish,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Up From The Skies,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Crosstown Traffic,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bleeding Heart (Peoples, Peoples, Peoples),Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Angel,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“...And The Gods Made Love,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Castles Made Of Sand, Stone Free,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Rainy Day, Dream Day/Still Raining, Still Dreaming,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“1983Ã¢â‚¬Â¦(A Merman I Should Turn To Be)Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bold as Love.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ They also offered an instrumental reading of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Machine Gun.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nArea saxophonist Chris Neal, who has performed with UmpreyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s McGee also sat in on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Rainy Day, Dream Day/Still Raining, Still Dreaming.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ He returned during GovÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t MuleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s encore for Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sco-MuleÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and a show-closing Ã¢â‚¬Å“Little WingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ during MuleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s encore. At the start of their encore segment, Mule also riffed on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Happy BirthdayÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to celebrate HendrixÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 70th birthday. \n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\nSet One:\n\n 1.
