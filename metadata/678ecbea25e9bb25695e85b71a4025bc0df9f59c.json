However the file is completely usable with no limits. I have tested on two computers with 3 different programs and 2 operating systems.\n\nA note to all:\nI have a really slow upload limit on my network, I will continue to seed this, but in order for anyone to obtain real speed I will need other to help seed. So please continue to seed this for at least a week.\n\nIf there are any problems with the PDF please let me know and I'll do my best to fix it and re-upload. \n\nThank you, and enjoy,\nYurdle","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:678ecbea25e9bb25695e85b71a4025bc0df9f59c","amp;dn":"New+Perspectives+on+HTML+and+XHTML+Fifth+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"678ecbea25e9bb25695e85b71a4025bc0df9f59c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,142,203,234,37,233,187,37,105,94,133,183,26,64,37,188,13,249,245,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
