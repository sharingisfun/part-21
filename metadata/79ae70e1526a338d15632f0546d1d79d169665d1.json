The first night was dedicated to music from the EP through Empire.  The second had a lot of the same material, but removed some songs and added material from the Hear in the Now Frontier and Q2K albums.\n\nWhen the record was sequenced it was made into suites for each album.  This is not really how the set was ordered.  I have, therefore, reordered the album back to how it was played on those nights.  The sequencing of this is based on the setlist for the 27th up to the end of the Mindcrime stuff and the 28th for the rest.\n\n01 MN 156\n02 Walk in the Shadows\n03 Roads to Madness\n04 The Lady Wore Black\n05 London\n06 Screaming in Digital\n07 I Am I\n08 Damaged\n09 Empire\n10 Silent Luciity\n11 Another Rainy Night (Without You)\n12 Jet City Woman\n13 I Remember Now\n14 Revolution Calling\n15 Spreading the Disease part 1\n16 Electric Requiem\n17 Spreading the Disease part 2\n18 The Mission\n19 Suite Sister Mary\n20 I Don't Believe in Love\n21 My Empty Room\n22 Eyes of a Stranger\n23 Liquid Sky\n24 Sacred Ground\n25 Falling Down\n26 Hit the Black\n27 Breakdown\n28 The Right Side of My Mind\n29 Take Hold of the Flame\n30 Queen of the Reich","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79ae70e1526a338d15632f0546d1d79d169665d1","amp;dn":"Queensryche+-+Live+Evolution+%28resequened+by+%7D%7Beywood%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79ae70e1526a338d15632f0546d1d79d169665d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,174,112,225,82,106,51,141,21,99,47,5,70,209,215,157,22,150,101,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
