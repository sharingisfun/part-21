They signed to Warner Brothers, recruited vocalist Mo Armstrong, and released the single, &quot;High Again&quot;/&quot;To The Rescue&quot; and the &quot;Daddy Longlegs&quot;.\n\nWith both Armstrong and Hayton leaving soon after, Carrison and Palomaki recruited vocalist/pianist Pete Arnesen and guitarist/vocalist Gary &quot;Norton&quot; Holderman and became one of the first American acts to sign to Vertigo Records. The 12-track &quot;Oakdown Farm&quot; LP was released in 1971 and has remained a collectors item ever since.\n\nThis was the act's second album and has elements of country music to basic rock styles and is an authentic taste of that relaxed, open feel which is the essence of American rural culture. \n\n01.
