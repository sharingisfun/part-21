Well actually it isn&amp;#039;t... this is 407 samples taken from two 808&amp;#039;s recorded into an Ampex 351 1/2&quot; valve 2 track tape machine! That&amp;#039;s not all... We also put the 808&amp;#039;s through other vintage gear. Plus we recorded the 808&amp;#039;s naked into a Metric Halo ULN-2 firewire audio card. Then we chose the best samples.\n\nAll 24 bit, and all phat analog goodness!\n\nIf you can&amp;#039;t get a hold of a real 808 then this is as close as you can get in samples... Maybe even better than the having the real thing!&quot;\n\nI say: This samples are cool, if you like them and use them, consider buying something from Goldbaby.co.nz to show your support!\n\nDownload link:\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c65247f034af42dbd7f256faa90bbf82b21ec3e","amp;dn":"Tape808+Samples+by+GoldBaby","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c65247f034af42dbd7f256faa90bbf82b21ec3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,101,36,127,3,74,244,45,189,127,37,111,170,144,187,248,43,33,236,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
