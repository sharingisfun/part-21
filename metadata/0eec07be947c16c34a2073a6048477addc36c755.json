So fast and widespread was the attack no-one could work out how it had happened, until one of the hackers called the New York Times to brag about it. Ten years after their arrest, this dramatized documentary reveals not only how they did it but why, taking us headlong into the clandestine, risky but intoxicating world of the computer underground.\n- Written by Kevin Anderson ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0eec07be947c16c34a2073a6048477addc36c755","amp;dn":"In+The+Realm+Of+The+Hackers+%282003%29+MP4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0eec07be947c16c34a2073a6048477addc36c755","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,236,7,190,148,124,22,195,74,32,115,166,4,132,119,173,220,54,199,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
