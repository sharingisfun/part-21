Time warped means the audio is played 35% faster but without changing the pitch. They just talk a lot faster =)\nThe reason behind this is to save time for the JRE junkies out there, you save about 50 minutes of your life on a 3 hour podcast. Aint that just great? Since its encoded with OGG aoTuVb q0 its also smaller in filesize and good quality.\n\n\nGuests: Tom Segura, Christina Pazsitzky\nSponsors: Onnit (http://www.onnit.com), Ting (http://rogan.ting.com) etc..","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b23592a22b8e5927d4a0ad7ce50d85e92e898fe","amp;dn":"Joe+Rogan+Experience+Podcast+%23295+-+Tom+Segura%2C+Christina+Pazsit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b23592a22b8e5927d4a0ad7ce50d85e92e898fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,35,89,42,34,184,229,146,125,74,10,215,206,80,216,94,146,232,152,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
