ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a difficult assignment, complicated further by the fact that her long-time flame Detective Ryan is investigating the infantsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ mother, a former (and possibly current) prostitute. When the woman flees to Edmonton, the investigation is joined by Royal Canadian Mounted Police sergeant with whom Tempe had an ill-advised fling over a decade earlier. The dissonant team heads to remotest Yellowknife - mining country - to pursue an ever more sinister trail.\n\nWith the Fox series Bones in its seventh season and her popularity at its broadest ever, Kathy Reichs reaches new heights in storytelling and suspense-building. Bones Are Forever shimmers with sexual tension, crackling dialogue, and the thrilling twists Reichs delivers so well.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a15aad4f796cc9d5e34a586839ed111b9db87b1","amp;dn":"Kathy+Reichs+Bones+are+Forever+%28Tempe+Brennan+15%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a15aad4f796cc9d5e34a586839ed111b9db87b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,21,170,212,247,150,204,157,94,52,165,134,131,158,209,17,185,219,135,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
