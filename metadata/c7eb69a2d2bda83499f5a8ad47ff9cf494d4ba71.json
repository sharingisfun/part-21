It supports all the major e-book formats. The full list of formats can be found here.\r\nThe conversion engine has lots of powerful features. It can rescale all font sizes, ensuring the output e-book is readable no matter what font sizes the input document uses. It can automatically detect/create book structure, like chapters and Table of Contents. It can insert the book metadata into a &quot;Book Jacket&quot; at the start of the book.\r\n\r\nSyncing to e-book reader devices\r\nIt has a modular device driver design that makes adding support for different e-reader devices easy.

Syncing supports updating metadata on the device from metadata in the library and creation of collections on the device based on the tags defined in the library. If a book has more than one format available, calibre automatically chooses the best format when uploading to the device. If none of the formats is suitable, calibre will automatically convert the e-book to a format suitable for the device before sending it.\r\nDownloading news from the web and converting it into e-book form\r\nIt can automatically fetch news from websites or RSS feeds, format the news into a ebook and upload to a connected device. The e-books include the full versions of the articles, not just the summaries. calibre has over three hundred news sources and the news system is plugin based, allowing users to easily create and contribute new sources to calibre. As a result the collection of news sources keeps on growing!\r\nComprehensive e-book viewer\r\nIt has a built-in ebook viewer that can display all the major ebook formats.

Getting some, even partially corrupted text is better than no text.\r\nBook details: Fix single value custom text column not clickable.\r\nSaving to disk: Fix custom date column being rendered in GMT instead of the local time zone when used in a save to disk template.\r\nImproved news sources:\r\nNew York Review of Books\r\nCaravan Magazine\r\n\r\n* Open with winrar/winzip..
