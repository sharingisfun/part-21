Tracks have been produced by both Ethan Johns and Steve Lillywhite and the album was released on June 30, 2007 in Australia, July 2 in the United Kingdom and July 10 in North America.[5] Time on Earth is the band\\&amp;#039;s first studio album since 1993, and marks the reunion of the band eleven years after they disbanded and features new drummer Matt Sherrod in place of the original drummer, Paul Hester, who took his own life in 2005.\n\nAs the first studio album from the group in fourteen years, Time on Earth has been subject to much speculation. Upon its release the album garnered positive critical reception and reached Platinum status within weeks of release in Australia,[16] and Gold status in its second week of release in New Zealand.[17] In conjunction and promotion of the album, the group is currently touring internationally, which was begun by performing at Coachella music festival and at Live Earth in July. For further promotion, three singles have been released from the album, \\&quot;Don\\&amp;#039;t Stop Now\\&quot;, \\&quot;She Called Up\\&quot; and \\&quot;Pour Le Monde\\&quot;, and a special tour edition of the album was released in Australia in November 2007 featuring an extra CD with eleven songs from a concert from the album\\&amp;#039;s North American tour.\n\nTracklisting:\n\n1. \t\\&quot;Nobody Wants To\\&quot; \t\n2. \t\\&quot;Don\\&amp;#039;t Stop Now\\&quot; \t\n3. \t\\&quot;She Called Up\\&quot; \t\n4. \t\\&quot;Say That Again\\&quot; \t\n5. \t\\&quot;Pour Le Monde\\&quot; \t\n6. \t\\&quot;Even a Child\\&quot; \t\n7. \t\\&quot;Heaven That I\\&amp;#039;m Making\\&quot; \t\n8. \t\\&quot;A Sigh\\&quot; \t\n9. \t\\&quot;Silent House\\&quot; \t\n10. \t\\&quot;English Trees\\&quot; \t\n11. \t\\&quot;Walked Her Way Down\\&quot; \t\n12. \t\\&quot;Transit Lounge\\&quot; \t\n13. \t\\&quot;You Are the One to Make Me Cry\\&quot; \t\n14. \t\\&quot;People Are Like Suns\\&quot; \n\n\nGenre - Soft Rock\n\nYear of Release - 2007\n\nRipped by - Emma\n\nFile Size - 83.6 Mb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc83dada20407f61f34dc1736dd24376a1c739d4","amp;dn":"Crowded+House+-+Time+On+Earth","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc83dada20407f61f34dc1736dd24376a1c739d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,131,218,218,32,64,127,97,243,77,193,115,109,210,67,118,161,199,57,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
