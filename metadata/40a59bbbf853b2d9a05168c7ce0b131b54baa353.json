For most of those who worked Hollywood's sound stages by day, also blew jazz by night at local clubs.\nThe commencement of Sunday afternoon jams at The Lighthouse on May 29 1949 and Shorty Rogers recording his Modern Sounds 10-inch for Capitol on October 8, 1951 are regarded as the two major events that signify what became universally refered to as the West Coast Scene. Long before that, jazz had been an intregral part of the area's local night life especially along Central Avenue (the Harlem of the West Coast) where Dexter Gordon was the key figure along with Warded Gray, Teddy Edwards, Sonny Criss and Hampton Hawes. A bustling locale crammed with clubs such as Billy Berg's, The Jungle Room and Jack's Basket that nightly presented jukebox stars of the calibre of Slim Gaillard, Charles Brown,\nLouis Jordan and Nat Cole.\nHowever, by the early 1950s, the indiginous music scene had, in the quest for the almighty dollar, polarized along race lines, and (white) West Coast Jazz was a commercial reality. It's bright primary coloured leisure image was meant to reflect an optimistic and affluent postwar mood of prosperity. Not for these guys the smoke and shadows of New York's jazz cellars. Out on the coast, the air was fresh, palm trees lined the avenues and the big decision of the day was whether to surf or golf!\nLook closer and it was obvious that this was a surface image - albeit well intended. Likewise, listen closely to the wide cross section of music contained herein and it's obvious that, from Mulligan and Pepper right through to Edwards and Criss, there's much more depth than the whole movement was first credited with.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/O8fqbxT.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/O8fqbxT.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n01.
