Coco decides that her TV premiere with supermodels Naomi Campbell and Karolina Kurkova is the perfect opportunity to hire a stylist for the first time. With the pressure to perform already high, Brad quickly realizes that he may have misjudged her tastes. Then, Brad styles the ad campaign for Noot's headphones. Working with a new client who is not only the model, but also the creative director and company owner might be too much for Brad to handle. Later, Brad and Gary start to decorate their new home.\n\n\nThanks to RKSTR for capping and sharing.\n\nEnjoy!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b919e0599abd55d17738015dd6cb87c0de114cb7","amp;dn":"Its.A.Brad.Brad.World.S02E06.A.E.I.O.U.HDTV.x264-RKSTR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b919e0599abd55d17738015dd6cb87c0de114cb7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,25,224,89,154,189,85,209,119,56,1,93,214,203,135,192,222,17,76,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
