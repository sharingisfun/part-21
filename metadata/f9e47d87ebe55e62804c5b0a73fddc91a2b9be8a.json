STORY INFO: \n\nNova Video Library: B-29 Frozen in Time follows Darryl Greenamyer and his crew as they try to retrieve an almost intact B-29 from the Arctic Circle. The airplane crash-landed nearly 50 years earlier during a secret mission for the United States. The pilots survived the crash and were rescued, but the B-29 was left in the harsh and unforgiving climate 250 miles north of Thule, Greenland. Greenamyer, a former test pilot who set a low-altitude speed record in a jet he built from spare parts, believes that he can actually fly the plane after performing some maintenance and building a short runway. He flies in parts for the B-29 and a massive bulldozer to clear the runway, but every takeoff is dangerous in these conditions, and he and his crew have a short window for success due to the brief summer. Greenamyer also faces a limited budget and other difficult hurdles as they try to resurrect a piece of history and fly it home. ~ Thomas Carpenter, All Movie Guide\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://movies.nytimes.com/movie/188208/Nova-B-29-Frozen-in-Time/overview&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://movies.nytimes.com/movie/188208/Nova-B-29-Frozen-in-Time/overview&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9e47d87ebe55e62804c5b0a73fddc91a2b9be8a","amp;dn":"B29+Frozen+In+Time","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9e47d87ebe55e62804c5b0a73fddc91a2b9be8a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,228,125,135,235,229,94,98,128,76,91,10,115,253,220,145,162,185,190,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
