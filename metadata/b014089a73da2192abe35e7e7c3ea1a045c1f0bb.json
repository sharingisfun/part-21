Now, in her magnificent work of storytelling and imagination Margaret George bring us Henry VIII's story as he himself might have told it, in memoirs interspersed with irreverent comments from his jester and confident, Will Somers. Brilliantly combining history, wit, dramatic narrative, and an extraordinary grasp of the pleasures and perils of power, this monumental novel shows us Henry the man more vividly than he has ever been seen before.\n\nPublisher: St. Martin's Griffin; 1st edition (September 15, 1998)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0312194390\nISBN-13: 978-0312194390\n\nSee a tiny collection of my torrents.
