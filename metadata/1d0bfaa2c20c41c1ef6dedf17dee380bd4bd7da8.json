Then Regan gets a chance for a fresh start in the Napa Valley. With her dream job, dream home, and her daughter enrolled in a wonderful new school, she starts wondering if holiday wishes really do come true.\n\nBut she soon tumbles back down to earth when she learns that her new boss is none other than Gabe DeLuca, the scorned wifeÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s brother. Gabe wants nothing more than home-wrecking Regan Martin out of his life, his sisterÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s world, and his familyÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s business. Mostly, he wants the lush beauty out of his head. Yet his attempts to run her out of town have him thinking twice, especially when he sees that Regan may hold the key to tracking down his sisterÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s stolen start-up capital. Even worse for Gabe, Regan might just be his Christmas wish and hold the key to his heart.\n\nSummer in Napa (St. Helena Vineyard #2) by Marina Adair (May 14th 2013)\n\nSix months ago, New York restaurant owner Alexis Ã¢â‚¬Å“LexiÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Moreau walked in on her husband, Jeff, and their sous chef mixing business with pleasure. Now, Lexi is back in her hometown of St. Helena, California, rebuilding her life and hoping to turn her grandmotherÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s patisserie into the bistro of her dreams. All she needs is luck, lots of hard work, and a way to avoid the thirty blind dates her matchmaking grandmother arranged. Enter Marco DeLuca Ã¢â‚¬â€ JeffÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s handsome, commitment-phobe best friend who has always had his sights set on Lexi. In high school, Marco convinced himself that Lexi was off-limits. And she still is, especially since MarcoÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s familyÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s wine business all depends on a deal with Jeff. But a fake summer romance is the perfect way for Lexi to distract the would-be suitors her grandmother has set up for her. A perfect way for Marco to realize sheÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the only one that ever mattered. And a perfect way to fall deliciously in love.\n\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d0bfaa2c20c41c1ef6dedf17dee380bd4bd7da8","amp;dn":"St.+Helena+Vineyard+Series+%281-2%29+by+Marina+Adair+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d0bfaa2c20c41c1ef6dedf17dee380bd4bd7da8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,11,250,162,194,12,65,193,239,109,237,241,125,238,56,11,212,189,125,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
