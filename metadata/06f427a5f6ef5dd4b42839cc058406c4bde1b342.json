On V.E. Day, Nora gives birth to their son, who she names Tommy. While Tommy is an adolescent, Nora marries Frank, a shifty camp counselor. Shortly thereafter, Tommy suffers an emotionally traumatic experience associated with his father and step-father, which, based on things told to him at that time, results in him becoming deaf, dumb and blind, a situation which several people exploit for their own pleasure. As Nora tries several things to bring Tommy out of his psychosomatic disabilities, Tommy, now a young man, happens upon pinball as a stimulus. Playing by intuition, Tommy becomes a pinball master, which in turn makes him, and by association Nora and Frank, rich and famous. Nora literally shatters Tommy to his awakening, which ultimately leads to both the family's rise and downfall as people initially try to emulate Tommy's path then rebel against it.                \r\n\r\nYear: 1975                \r\nDirector: Ken Russell                \r\nWriters: The Who, Ken Russell, Pete Townshend, John Entwistle, Keith Moon                \r\nStars: Oliver Reed, Ann-Margret, Roger Daltrey, Elton John, Eric Clapton, John Entwistle, Keith Moon, Paul Nicholas, Jack Nicholson, Robert Powell                \r\nGenres: Drama, Musical                \r\nLanguage: English                \r\n\r\nRELEASE.....................: Tommy.1975.1080p.BluRay.x264.VPPV\r\nVIDEO.......................: 3000 kbps  \r\nCODEC.......................: x264\r\nRESOLUTION..................: 1920x1040                \r\nFRAME RATE..................: 23.976 fps\r\nAUDIO.......................: 5.1 Channel / AC3 / 384kbps                \r\nFILE SIZE / FORMAT..........: 2.64 GiB / MP4\r\nSOURCE......................: BluRay                \r\n\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nPoster:  \nhttp://snap.vppv.la/tommy/1975/tommy-1975-poster.jpg               \r\n\r\nWarning!!!
