Cinematography was by Frank Redman and the film was scored by Leigh Harline. It is based on a play by Wilhelm Speyer and stars Tom Conway, Audrey Long, Edward Brophy, Louis Borel and Addison Richards. \n\nTom Conway, who usually plays &quot;the Falcon,&quot; is doing a little extracurricular detective work in RKO's &quot;A Night of Adventure,&quot; which came to the Rialto yesterday. And with the customary suavity of &quot;the Falcon,&quot; he is wriggling his way out of a spot in which he himself, a crime lawyer, is suspected in the death of a girl. \n\nMost of the suspense in the picture is built in a tricky courtroom scene, for which the writer provided a neat bit of syllogistic plot. The rest is a modest imitation of some previous husband-wife detective films, with Audrey Long playing the rather attractive and difficult wife of the great man.\n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 400mb\nDuration.... 01:04:59\nCodec.... avc1\nFrame Width..... 512\nFrame Height.... 384\nData Rate.... 693kbps\nFrame Rate.... 23F/S\nAUDIO\nBit Rate.... 164kbps\n2 Channel Stereo\nAudio Sample Rate.... 48 KHz\nBits Per Sample 16 Bit/Sample","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b61d9d4d684b66c0b96f5990650ab59882c1bff","amp;dn":"A+Night+of+Adventure+1944+DvdRip+Mp4+Lee1001","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b61d9d4d684b66c0b96f5990650ab59882c1bff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,97,217,212,214,132,182,108,11,150,245,153,6,80,171,89,136,44,27,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
