It's almost impossible to summarize them, most of them aren't really plot driven but they deal with abnormal states of the mind and are permeated by a general surrealism. As in many of this works, he shows references to the art and culture of 1920s and 1930s Japan and Germany which had inspired his own artistic style.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2487cacf7ed531693af184858e8de0eebd0fa6df","amp;dn":"Suehiro+Maruo%3A+Parnoia+Star+%28Eng%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2487cacf7ed531693af184858e8de0eebd0fa6df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,135,202,207,126,213,49,105,58,241,132,133,142,141,224,238,189,15,166,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
