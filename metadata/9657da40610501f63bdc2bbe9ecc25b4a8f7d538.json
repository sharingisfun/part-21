However, when his brother mysteriously disappears, Jeff takes Nate's paranoia seriously, and in the process uncovers the dark underworld of the TV show &quot;Cult&quot; and its rabid fans. The only person who seems willing to help Jeff with his investigation is Skye, a young research assistant for &quot;Cult,&quot; who has also started to grow suspicious of the increasingly dark happenings surrounding the show. The fictitious show, centered on the cat-and-mouse game between charismatic cult leader Billy Grimm and LAPD detective Kelly Collins, has become an obsession for its viewers Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and now some of its devotees seem to be taking their fixation to deadly extremes in the real world.
