Turns out that after recording the album so many people asked for it he thought why not just release it to the public as a straight spoken word cd. So here it is... Shut Up And Say Something is an intensely personal album touching on subjects from politics to family to love and loss in a way only Shane can deliver.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:73aa4de61327451bcf100e97c4639934d583f27a","amp;dn":"shanekoyczan2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"73aa4de61327451bcf100e97c4639934d583f27a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,170,77,230,19,39,69,27,207,16,14,151,196,99,153,52,213,131,242,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
