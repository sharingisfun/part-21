It was released as the third single for her second studio album Warrior, with will.i.am as a featured artist.[2] Additional remixes for the track have been released, one featuring her Kemosabe Records labelmate Juicy J and another featuring her co-headlining tourmate, Pitbull. The lyrics were written by Kesha and will.i.am along with Dr. Luke, Benny Blanco, Cirkut, who also helmed production of the track. Featuring whistling, the song is of the techno-pop genre with traces of pop rap. While the album version of the song was praised for the acoustic guitar refrains and electronic and hip hop verses, the rap vocals contributed by will.i.am were ubiquitously met with unfavorable reviews.\nA music video for the track premiered on MTV on 28 May 2013 at 7:53 PM EST, following the finale of her television documentary, Kesha: My Crazy Beautiful Life. Reaching the top ten in Korea and Ukraine, the song was a commercial flop in her main market, the United States, where it only managed to reach ten on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart and barely broke into the Mainstream Top 40.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:262dff50e326586d517e35d8ffa6ac0a07d25bf4","amp;dn":"Ke%24ha+-+Crazy+Kids+ft.+Will.i.am+%28Official+Music+Video%29.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"262dff50e326586d517e35d8ffa6ac0a07d25bf4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,45,255,80,227,38,88,109,81,126,53,216,255,166,172,10,7,210,91,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
