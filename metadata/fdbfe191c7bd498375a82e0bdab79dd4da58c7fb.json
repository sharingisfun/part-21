Their music brings new vitality to both the traditions of Eastern Europe and the roots of &quot;Tsigane Jazz&quot;, as made world famous by Django Reinhardt and Stephane Grapelli. With great emotion, poignant melodies and subtle arrangements, they create a unique acoustic music, which, for years, has been enthralling both the French audiences and the press in equal measure. Their first live album is a rare document, recording their very first German concert. &quot;These vagabonds carry the nostalgia of Eastern Europe in their bundles, the vibrancy of the Mediterranean, the dexterity of the Gypsies and the irony of the Jews. Music without frontiers.&quot; (Le Monde) &quot;A wondrous journey from West to East with a band of joyously abandoned nomads, who poke fun at all restraints. Whether the tunes they play are Gypsy, Russian, Armenian, or Yiddish, or their own original songs, they have the audience on its feet, shouting for more.&quot; (LÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Express) &quot;The music of Bratsch is vital, lyrical, raw and romantic, but never sentimental and certainly never saccharine.&quot;\n\n| MP3 320 kbps | Incl.
