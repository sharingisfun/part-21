The companyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first release was a brand new Big Smo studio album, appropriately titled Ã¢â‚¬Å“American MadeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.  Songs like Ã¢â‚¬Å“My Life In A JarÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ , Ã¢â‚¬Å“Old Dirt RoadÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Kickin It In TennesseeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ send the listener on a thrill ride through the country in an old Ford with no brakes. Guest appearances by many of NashvilleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s underground heros and studio musicians added incredable flavor to an already infectious slab of musical delight.\n             Big SmoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s popularity began to rise throughout the nation catapulting him into a never ending tour of shows including the Mud Bog and Trail Riding circuit in states like Florida , Georgia , Alabama , Tennessee and Texas.
