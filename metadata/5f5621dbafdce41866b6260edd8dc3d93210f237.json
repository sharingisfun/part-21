Players must hack and slash their way through a cartoony medieval landscape and save the princesses. The game features 4 player co-op over Xbox Live/PSN and locally on one system. Castle Crashers also has RPG elements where you can level up your characters. On top of the 4 knights of the game, there are a slew of unlockable character to be found.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f5621dbafdce41866b6260edd8dc3d93210f237","amp;dn":"Castle+Crashers+%5BEng+%7BMULTi10%7D+%2F+Eng%5D+%5B2DLC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f5621dbafdce41866b6260edd8dc3d93210f237","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,86,33,219,175,220,228,24,102,182,38,14,221,141,195,217,50,16,242,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
