These assassins, known as &quot;Agents&quot; are unable to feel guilt, remorse, or fear of their actions. Litvenko, having a crisis of conscience, eventually sees the danger of creating genetically engineered killing machines, and disappears, leaving behind his young daughter, Katia. Many agencies and organizations tried over the years to replicate the Agent Program, yet all had failed. A corporation known as Syndicate International determines that the only way to truly replicate the program is to find Litvenko. Syndicate member Dr. Delriego is on the brink of locating Litvenko when he and his security detail are attacked and killed by Agent 47 (Rupert Friend), tasked with stopping the Syndicate from getting their hands on Litvenko by the ICA (International Contracts Agency). 47 is contacted by his handler Diana (Angelababy), who informs him of two new kill orders to fulfill.\n\nA now adult Katia (Hannah Ware) lives in Berlin. She works tirelessly to find her father, and is plagued by overwhelming anxiety and an acute awareness of everything around her, even being able to see and hear things well outside a person's normal sensory radius. Katia is approached at a subway station by a man calling himself John Smith (Zachary Quinto). He claims that 47 is on his way to kill her, and offers her protection, while alluding that he has information about her father. 47 finds and attacks the pair, who are able to escape, but not before 47 grazes Katia's arm with a sniper bullet. Smith and Katia hide out in a hotel room where Katia shows him her map of clues to finding her father. Just as she is able to determine that Litvenko is in Singapore, 47 bursts through the door, shoots Smith in the chest, and knocks Katia unconscious. Elsewhere, Diana contacts another Agent about a contract.\n\nto continue ...\n\nenjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb3c0933ad1a5e0d875ece5dd76ca9db9549328b","amp;dn":"Hitman+Agent+47+%282015%29+CAM+.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb3c0933ad1a5e0d875ece5dd76ca9db9549328b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,60,9,51,173,26,94,13,135,94,206,93,215,108,169,219,149,73,50,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
