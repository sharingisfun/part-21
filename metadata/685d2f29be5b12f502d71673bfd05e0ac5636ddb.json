Awards have been given for people who &quot;do a service to Humanity by removing themselves from the gene pool&quot; (i.e., lose the ability to reproduce either by death or sterilization in an idiotic fashion). According to Wendy Northcutt, author of the Darwin Award books: &quot;The Awards honor people who ensure the long-term survival of the human race by removing themselves from the gene pool in a sublimely idiotic fashion.&quot; The Darwin Award books state that an attempt is made to disallow known urban legends from the awards, but some older &quot;winners&quot; have been 'grandfathered' to keep their awards. The Darwin Awards site[1] does try to verify all submitted stories, but many similar sites, and the vast number of circulating &quot;Darwin awards&quot; emails, are largely fictional.\n\nSOURCE: Wikipedia.\n\n\nSeed please, and comments.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:685d2f29be5b12f502d71673bfd05e0ac5636ddb","amp;dn":"Darwin+Awards+%28+3+Books+%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"685d2f29be5b12f502d71673bfd05e0ac5636ddb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,93,47,41,190,91,18,245,2,215,22,115,191,208,94,10,197,99,109,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
