It is too close for their own pilot to react, but in one skillful move their forerunner swoops out of the way and the crewÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lives are saved. Back on the runway the seven, thankful young men eagerly await their saviorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s return and are stunned, when the pilot climbs down from the cockpit, to find themselves face to face with female Air Transport Auxiliary pilot Grace Baker. Grace quickly befriends the crew, introducing them to their new Bomber, TuesdayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Child, and ensconcing herself in their spare bunk. Then when rear gunner &quot;Pete the Pole&quot; absconds, the guys donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t think twice about asking Grace to secretly take his place in &quot;Tuesday&quot; as they return to Germany. As radio operator Charlie Bassett regales the reader with the drama of combat during his eight weeks aboard TuesdayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Child in 1944, a funny, authentic and deeply humane tale unfolds, racing vividly across the page, emotionally entwining the reader in the lives and friendships of its extraordinary characters, and awakening us to the heroics and realities of war.\n\nWritten by David Fiddimore \nFormat: MP3 \nUnabridged\n\nSee a tiny collection of my torrents.
