While it is as easy to use like a normal word processor, Help &amp; Manual gives you the full power of a true WYSIWYG XML editor. All the tools you need are at your fingertips in a single intuitive environment, and the program handles all the complex, technical aspects of the process for you. Instead of wasting countless hours &quot;programming&quot; your help you can focus all your energy on actually writing your documentation, so that all your working time is productive time. All the output formats supported by Help &amp; Manual are generated from the same project. This means you only have to edit your help and documentation once. Forget about the nightmare of &quot;converting&quot; your documentation every time you change anything.\n\nIntuitive working environment\n\nHelp &amp; ManualÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â´s working environment gives you all the formatting and editing features of a modern word processor, including dynamic styles and complex tables.\n\nThis is combined with powerful features for generating and editing help and documentation files, including full support for multimedia and complex modular projects.\n\nYour projects are displayed and edited with the same hierarchical tree structure used by all Windows help formats. The editor and content tree view are combined in a single window. Editing topics and manipulating the structure of your projects is fast and intuitive.\n\nSingle source, Multiple output\n\nSingle source is much more than just outputting exactly the same information to different formats. Help &amp; Manual supports conditional and customized output features that enable you to include variant content versions for different output formats and purposes  all in the same project, no post-processing is required.\n\nHelp &amp; Manual handles all the complexities of help formatting and generation for you, letting you concentrate on the work of writing. But there is also extensive support for power users and experienced help authors. You can get under the hood and insert your own HTML code, change the code the program uses to generate your projects, manipulate topic and project templates and more.\n\nHelp &amp; Manual gives you the best of both worlds.\n\nGenerate all Windows help formats\n\nYou can output your projects to all standard Windows help formats (HTML Help, Winhelp and MS Help 2.0 / Visual Studio Help), and since Help &amp; Manual is directly integrated with the Microsoft compilers for these formats all your output is 100% standard-compliant.\n\n\nHelp &amp; Manual also generates Webhelp, PDF and Word RTF. In addition to this you can generate fully-formatted printed manuals directly from the same projects used for all the other formats.\n\nThe Webhelp output includes a full menu structure that emulates the appearance and functionality of HTML Help and includes full-text search with highlighting for found words.\n\nPDF output and printed manuals are fully customizable with the bundled Print Manual Designer program: You can include a table of contents and a keyword index, automatic page referrers for links and cross-references, customized page layouts, headers, footers, page numbering, covers, introductions and more.\n\nAll languages of this world\n\nThis world is a big place and localization becomes ever more important. Help &amp; Manual lets you create documentation in up to 106 languages. It is one of the few help authoring tools that fully support Unicode and can handle languages like Japanese, Chinese, Korean and many others.\n\nHelp &amp; Manual 5 Professional saves projects in uncompressed XML format that can be directly translated with external editors.\nEasy migration\n\nOne of the most critical tasks is to migrate existing documentation when you switch to another tool. And this has never been easier than now. Help &amp; Manual imports regular HTML and text files, compiled HTML Help, Word files (RTF format), Winhelp source files and even decompiles HLP files.\n\nThis time no key.gen I give you Serial and activation!!!!\n\nEnjoy\n\n\n\nNeed more keys??? Just tell in comments and I post more :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f788ebb93c7f6ccd428651be30c657f76290dd7","amp;dn":"Help.And.Manual.v5.0.6.668.Professional.Incl.Keygen-SSG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f788ebb93c7f6ccd428651be30c657f76290dd7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,120,142,187,147,199,246,204,212,40,101,27,227,12,101,127,118,41,13,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
