Her father, a dancehall tour promoter, \nhelped her sign with Decca in 1962.[2] She made 4 singles before moving to \nEMI's Columbia label in 1965, where 'Cloda Rogers' made the 1966 single \n&quot;Stormy Weather&quot;/&quot;Lonely Room&quot;.[3] Although none of her Decca or Columbia \nsingles made the UK Singles Chart, Rodgers became regular face on British \ntelevision and appeared in the musical films Just for Fun and It's All Over \nTown. She also appeared in various song festivals, finishing third in the \nEuropean Song Cup competition in Greece with &quot;Powder Your Face With \nSunshine&quot; Her career changed dramatically when she married John Morris, \nwho became her manager. She signed a 3-single deal with RCA in 1968, but \nthe first 2 failed to chart. When Producer and songwriter Kenny Young heard \none of them, Clodagh Rodgers finally shot to fame in 1969 under his creative \nwing and with Morris' management. &quot;Come Back and Shake Me&quot; and \n&quot;Goodnight Midnight&quot; both hit Top 5 hits and made her the bestselling female \nsingles artist of 1969. The further single releases &quot;Biljo&quot;, &quot;Everybody Go \nHome, The Party's Over&quot;, and &quot;Lady Love Bug&quot; continued her chart success in \nthe next few years. Young wrote and produced many of these songs. She \nalso recorded &quot;Scrapbook,&quot; penned by Billy Ritchie, which appeared on her \n1969 album Midnight Clodagh. In 1970 she recorded &quot;Give Me Just a Little \nMore Line&quot; with Young under the name Moonshine.\nIn 1970 she was asked to represent the UK in the 1971 Eurovision Song \nContest in Dublin.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n            Clodagh Rodgers - You Are My Music...
