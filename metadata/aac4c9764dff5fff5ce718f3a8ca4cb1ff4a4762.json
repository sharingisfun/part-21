The album was reissued in 1989 by Virgin Records on CD. The reissue included an extra track, &quot;My Baby Loves Me&quot;. This track, recorded live at the Budokan Hall, Tokyo, Japan, on 22 September 1977, was originally part of the double LP set Live at the Budokan, and had been omitted from the UK release in error.\n\nIan Gillan re-used the vocal melody of the title track &quot;Scarabus&quot; on the song &quot;Disturbing the Priest&quot; six years later, on the album Born Again during his short tenure with the British hard rock/heavy metal band Black Sabbath. The guitar riff on &quot;Mercury High&quot; is the same as the one played by Fenwick on &quot;Back USA&quot; from his 1971 solo album &quot;Keep America Beautiful, Get a Haircut&quot;.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n    &quot;Scarabus&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:53\n    &quot;Twin Exhausted&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:08\n    &quot;Poor Boy Hero&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:08\n    &quot;Mercury High&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:31\n    &quot;Pre-release&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:22\n    &quot;Slags to Bitches&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:09\n    &quot;Apathy&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:19\n    &quot;Mad Elaine&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:15\n    &quot;Country Lights&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:16\n    &quot;Fool's Mate&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:19\n    &quot;My Baby Loves Me&quot; [LIVE]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aac4c9764dff5fff5ce718f3a8ca4cb1ff4a4762","amp;dn":"Ian+Gillan+Band+-+Scarabus+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aac4c9764dff5fff5ce718f3a8ca4cb1ff4a4762","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,196,201,118,77,255,95,255,92,231,24,243,168,202,76,177,255,74,71,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
