An &quot;exporter&quot; of tactics, ideas, and experts, Argentina has become a site of innovation in the field of human rights. This book investigates two prominent Buenos Aires protest organizationsÃ¢â‚¬â€Memoria Activa and the BAUEN workers' cooperativeÃ¢â‚¬â€to consider how each has framed its demands within a language of rights.Fundamentally, this book is concerned with the complex interrelationship between the discourse of human rights and the neoliberal project. In exploring the way in which &quot;rights talk&quot; is used and adapted locally by various activist groups, the book looks at the mutually formative and contentious interactions between ideas of human rights, rights of citizenship, and the concrete and envisioned social relationships that form the basis for social activism in the wake of neoliberalism.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:24f8c8602a741ceb9c5f0665dd274f051df6a1b1","amp;dn":"In+The+Wake+of+Neoliberalism+-+Karen+Ann+Faulk.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"24f8c8602a741ceb9c5f0665dd274f051df6a1b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,248,200,96,42,116,28,235,156,95,6,101,221,39,79,5,29,246,161,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
