Songs in which Cage sets words by writers whose\nvision was as independent as his own - James Joyce, Gertrude Stein,\nE. E. Cummings. As Paul Griffiths writes, &quot;The music exists in singing that\nhas a raw, living edge, and it exists in piano tone that can be utterly simple\nand utterly remarkable. There is also a third presence that of the producer,\nbringing forward the extraordinary resonances that come from Lubimov's piano,\nwith preparation or without.&quot; Lubimov championed Cage's work in Russia and\nlater had a close working relationship with the composer. He grasps both the\nplayfulness of the music and its message of freedom.\n\nRecorded December 2011 in Zurich.\n\nAlexei Lubimov piano, prepared piano\n\nNatalia Pschenitschnikova voice\n\n=======\n\nAlternate :\n\nmagnet:?xt=urn:btih:C06002E9638F4C07B8303A1FD7C796C8DDB8C272\n\n=======\n\nEnjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c06002e9638f4c07b8303a1fd7c796c8ddb8c272","amp;dn":"John+Cage+-+As+It+Is+-+2012+-+A.Lubimov+N.Pschenitschnikova+%5Bmp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c06002e9638f4c07b8303a1fd7c796c8ddb8c272","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,96,2,233,99,143,76,7,184,48,58,31,215,199,150,200,221,184,194,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
