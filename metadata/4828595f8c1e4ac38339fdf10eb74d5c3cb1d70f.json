I will only be posting KISS stuff as i get the time &amp; the seeders. I cant seed forever so after i have a few seeders its up to you all to keep it alive so i can upload some more for you guys. I eventually plan on uploading my entire collection which is basically as large as the KISS vault. If you have any requests just leave them in a comment ( i have everything). hope you all enjoy.\n\nPeace,\nThe KISS Hookup.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4828595f8c1e4ac38339fdf10eb74d5c3cb1d70f","amp;dn":"KISS+Live+collection+%28Every+song+KISS+has+ever+played+live+110+s","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4828595f8c1e4ac38339fdf10eb74d5c3cb1d70f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,40,89,95,140,30,74,195,131,57,253,241,14,183,77,92,60,177,215,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
