And that record album is getting hard to find. The ENTIRE PERFORMANCE should be issued on CD, not just the 12 songs that were on the LP. In this show, as with &quot;An Evening With John Denver&quot; issued a year or two earlier, Denver was backed by an orchestra conducted by Lee Holdridge. Denver&amp;#039;s shows with Holdridge continued through at least 1977, when &quot;John Denver Live at the Sydney Opera House&quot; was released in Australia. That LP has been issued on CD with bonus tracks in the United States, although with 15 songs and the band introduction, it is still well short of the full show. &quot;Live in London&quot; was another crackerjack performance from Denver in his heyday. Hopefully, if and when RCA gets around to putting it on CD, they&amp;#039;ll do it right and issue the whole concert _ on a two-CD set if necessary. Here&amp;#039;s hoping somebody from RCA reads \n\nthese things. ...\n\nInformation Disc:\n\n? Artist:    John Denver\n? Title:     Live In London\n? Year:     1976\n?
