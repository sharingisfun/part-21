Fully revised and expanded, Castings Second Edition covers the latest developments in the understanding of the role of the liquid metal in controlling the properties of cast materials, and indeed, of all metallic materials that have started in the cast form. Practising foundry engineers, designers, and students will find the revealing insights into the behaviour of castings essential in developing their inderstanding and practice. \n\nJohn Campbell OBE is a leading international figure in the castings industry, with over four decades of experience. He is the originator of the Cosworth Casting Process, the pre-eminent production process for automobile cylinder heads and blocks. He is also co-inventor of both the Baxi Casting Process (now owned by Alcoa) developed in the UK, and the newly emerging Alotech Casting Process in the USA. He is Professor of Casting Technology at the University of Birmingham, UK.\n\n* New edition of this internationally respected reference and textbook for engineers and students\n* Develops understanding of the concepts and practice of casting operations\n* 'Castings' is the key work on castings technology and process metallurgy, and an essential resource on contemporary developments and thinking on the new metallurgy of cast alloys\n* Revised and updated throughout, with new material on subjects including surface turbulence, the new theory of entrainment defects including folded film defects, plus the latest concepts of alloy theory\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nReviews:\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&quot;Castings is a must reference for all foundry engineers and castings designers.&quot;\n--American Foundrymens Society\n\n&quot;Its author has himself made an outstanding contribution to the advance in the science and engineering of metal founding over recent years, and his new look at old problems makes stimulating reading.&quot;\n--Cast Metals Journals\n\n&quot;This excellent book goes a long way towards bridging the gulf between theory and practice...The text is readable, accurate and lively. It combines usefulness to the foundryman with great interest for those researching in the solidification area and suitability as an undergraduate text.&quot;\n--Materials Science and Engineering\n\n&quot;Entertaining and fun to read. How refreshing to find an author writing on science and technology who is prepared to move out of the strait-jacket of conventional style and to be himself with realism, enthusiasm and a dry sense of humour.&quot;\n--The Metallurgist and Materials Technologist \n\n&quot;This is a work which the casting industry should welcome with open arms. No foundry, and no foundry technologist, can afford to be without it.&quot;\n--Foundry Trade Journal\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAbout the Author:\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJohn Campbell OBE is a leading international figure in the castings industry, with over four decades of experience.
