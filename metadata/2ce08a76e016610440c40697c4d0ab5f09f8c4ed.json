In this riveting biography, Shlaes traces CoolidgeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s improbable rise from a tiny town in New England to a youth so unpopular he was shut out of college fraternities at Amherst College up through Massachusetts politics. After a divisive period of government excess and corruption, Coolidge restored national trust in Washington and achieved what few other peacetime presidents have: He left office with a federal budget smaller than the one he inherited. A man of calm discipline, he lived by example, renting half of a two-family house for his entire political career rather than compromise his political work by taking on debt. Renowned as a throwback, Coolidge was in fact strikingly modernÃ¢â‚¬â€an advocate of womenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s suffrage and a radio pioneer. At once a revision of man and economics, Coolidge gestures to the country we once were and reminds us of qualities we had forgotten and can use today.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ce08a76e016610440c40697c4d0ab5f09f8c4ed","amp;dn":"Amity+Shlaes+-+Coolidge","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ce08a76e016610440c40697c4d0ab5f09f8c4ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,224,138,118,224,22,97,4,64,196,6,151,196,208,171,95,9,248,196,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
