Manfred Mann were chart regulars in the 1960s, and the first south-of-England-based group to top the US Billboard Hot 100 during the British invasion.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSoul of Mann is a 1967 compilation album of instrumental recordings by Manfred Mann, released by HMV Records shortly after the company dropped the group from its roster.
