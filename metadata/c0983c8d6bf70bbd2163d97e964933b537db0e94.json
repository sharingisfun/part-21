Some error happened in the distribution so that only mono versions were made for European video distributors and TV/film channels. I had to order this edition especially from the U.S.\n\nI read the novel after 'Garp' and had a hard time understanding which part of the plot took place where and why among these eccentric, sexually liberated family members, the Dancing Bear and the Farting Dog. When seeing the film, I finally understood that they moved to a revolutionary Europe AFTER the successful rape of Jodie Foster.\n\nImpress your English literature teacher and see the film first! (You don't have to tell.)\n\nWidescreen, good stereo, XviD Two-pass 608x448 AC3\nBurn tested, runs well in my DivX player.\n\n\nFormat/Info                  : Audio Video Interleave\nFormat/Family                : RIFF\nFile size                    : 694 MiB\nPlayTime                     : 1h 48mn\nBit rate                     : 893 Kbps\nStreamSize                   : 7.26 MiB\n\nVideo #0\nCodec                        : XviD\nCodec/Family                 : MPEG-4V\nCodec/Info                   : XviD project\nCodec profile                : Streaming Video Profile/Level 1\nCodec settings, Packet bitst : Yes\nCodec settings, BVOP         : Yes\nCodec settings, QPel         : No\nCodec settings, GMC          : 0\nCodec settings, Matrix       : Default\nPlayTime                     : 1h 48mn\nBit rate                     : 756 Kbps\nWidth                        : 608 pixels\nHeight                       : 448 pixels\nDisplay Aspect ratio         : 4/3\nFrame rate                   : 23.976 fps\nResolution                   : 8 bits\nChroma                       : 4:2:0\nInterlacement                : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)           : 0.116\nStreamSize                   : 587 MiB\n\nAudio #0\nCodec                        : MPEG-1 Audio layer 3\nCodec profile                : Joint stereo\nPlayTime                     : 1h 48mn\nBit rate mode                : CBR\nBit rate                     : 128 Kbps\nMinimum bit rate             : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                   : 2 channels\nSampling rate                : 48 KHz\nResolution                   : 16 bits\nStreamSize                   : 99.4 MiB\nWriting library              : LAME3.97 \nEncoding settings            : CBR\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0983c8d6bf70bbd2163d97e964933b537db0e94","amp;dn":"Hotel+New+Hampshire+%281984%29+StereoWidescr+%5BOpt.Esp+subs%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0983c8d6bf70bbd2163d97e964933b537db0e94","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,152,60,141,107,247,11,189,33,99,217,126,150,73,51,181,55,219,14,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
