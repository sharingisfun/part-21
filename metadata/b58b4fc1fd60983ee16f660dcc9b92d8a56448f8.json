It featured two races, the human kingdom of Azeroth and the invading orcs. Subsequently Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness (usually simply called Warcraft II; sometimes abbreviated to WCII, WC2 or War2) was published as the long awaited sequel to the aforementioned popular real-time strategy game Warcraft: Orcs &amp; Humans. Users play either Orcs or Humans in a fantasy medieval world full of magic and swords. It was originally written for the DOS operating system, though it had a MS Windows launch screen and played well under Windows 95. In addition, there was a Macintosh version of the game. Blizzard also released an expansion pack for Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness known as Warcraft II: Beyond the Dark Portal.\n\nThis is a new Release of Warcraft One, Warcraft Two, Warcraft Three and their expansions. While the original releases and many subsequent releases did contain all the necessary files for a clean install of the Warcraft series, they were flawed by three critical Vista installation and playability problems, stability issues, audio-video problems, and poor documentation. By utilizing a modified version of DOS box, in conjunction with the latest patches and cracks, the issues which crippled earlier releases have been resolved.\n\nThis release is not portable as Warcraft Two requires registry entries which cannot be wrapped to the binaries. \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                              Miscellaneous Notes\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPlease Note The Following:\n\n.I.\nI take no responsibility for any damage that may come to your computer\nthrough the trial of this Crack-Mod. This mod has been tested to work \non Windows XP and Vista. No support or technical assistance will be provided. \nEver. Creation of this mod-crack took many hours of unpaid labour. \n.II.\nThe emulator utilized in this release was originally made by the DOS Box Team (http://www.dosbox.com/) who neither support nor condone software piracy. The Federation has released their work without their permission.\n.III.\nTo all the Fans, Friends, Foes, Members and Affiliates, of the FEDERATION:\n\n\t\t\t-----------------------\n\t\t\t|THANKS FOR EVERYTHING| \n                        -----------------------\n\nBecause of you we are &quot;STILL UNDERGROUND&quot; and &quot;STILL ALIVE&quot;.\n[54686f73652057686f204b6e6f772055732043616e2046696e64205573]\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                 Install Notes\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSteps:\n\n(1.) Extract the &quot;Warcraft Ultimate.rar&quot; file to your &quot;C:Program Files&quot; directory and then Navigate to the extracted directory (by default &quot;Warcraft&quot;) directory. Double-click on the &quot;Warcraft_Shortcuts.exe&quot; program. \n\n[Note]: This program is necessary as it not only creates shortcuts but also adds a vital registry entry (viewable in the &quot;C:Program FilesWarcraftWarcraft II&quot; directory). This program makes no changes to the game files which are already updated, modded, and cracked).\n\n(2.) Click through the installation instructions. Make certain that you install \nthe shortcut program to the &quot;Warcraft&quot; directory.\n\n(3.) Open the desired shortcut (which by default is) located on your desktop to \nstart the game. \n\n[Shortcut Information]:\n\n&quot;Warcraft One&quot;                    - Single player Warcraft One\n&quot;Warcraft Two&quot;                    - Singleplayer and Multiplayer Warcraft Two\n&quot;Warcraft Two - Map Editor&quot;\t  - Warcraft Two Mapping Utility\n&quot;Warcraft Three&quot;\t\t  - Singleplayer and Multiplayer Warcraft Three\n&quot;Warcraft Three - Map Editor&quot;\t  - Warcraft Three Mapping Utility\n\n[Extras]: The official manuals and covers are included in the &quot;C:Program FilesWarcraftExtras&quot; directory\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                  In The Pipeline\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nT-BOX - ZKZ of the Federation Team\n\nGames - Pending\nEMUs  - Complete\nNFO   - Pending\nTest  - Complete\n\nThis release is imminent. This project seeks to combine a Lite (less than 700m)\nVista build, bootscreen, frontend, registry tweaks, several related \napplications, twenty-plus emulators and tens of thousands of various game \nimages and roms in an orderly package. This package would then allow a user \nto easily create a SF personal computer (or any other light PC) that would \nact as any console from the first to sixth generation. This has been a huge\nundertaking but if it is successful this project will provide the PC scene with \nthe first real replacement for consoles. Please understand that projects like \nthis one can have unsuspected kinks. Please be patient.\n\nHalf Life Decay Co-op - The Decay Team\n\nGame  - Pending\nCrack - Pending\nNFO   - Pending\nMod   - Pending\nTest  - Pending\n\nWe are currently waiting for the Decay Team to release their Beta port (long \noverdue). Once they do, the game will be cracked (if necessary) and released \nA.S.A.P.\n\nQuake 4 Ultimate Co-op - Opencoop\n\nGame  - Pending\nCrack - Pending\nNFO   - Pending\nMod   - Pending\nTest  - Pending\n\nAs many of you know opencoop recently released a tech demo of their next project \nQuake 4 Co-op which allows you to traverse most of the levels, with large \namounts of lag, glitches, and crashes. Once they have a clean version working, \nthis Crack-Mod will be released. Because we are waiting for them to finish their \nwork there is no release date.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                  Recent Releases\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDiablo - Ultimate UPD*\t \t        |Sonic Comics Collection\n\t\t\t\t\t|\nGame  - Complete\t\t\t|Lib   - Complete\nCrack - Complete\t\t\t|NFO   - Complete\nNFO   - Complete\t\t\t|Test  - Complete\nTest  - Complete\t\t\t|URL   - http://thepiratebay.se/tor/\nURL   - http://thepiratebay.se/tor/\t|3933117/Sonic_Comics_Collection\n4260899\t\t\t\t\t|\n\nRoxio Easy Media Creator\t \t|Vampire Masquerade:Ultimate Bloodlines\n                                        |\nApp   - Complete\t\t\t|Game  - Complete\nCrack - Complete\t\t\t|Crack - Complete\nNFO   - Complete\t\t\t|NFO   - Complete\t\t\t\nTest  - Complete\t\t\t|Mod   - Complete\nURL   - http://thepiratebay.se/tor/\t|Test  - Complete\n3938149/ Roxio_Easy_Media_Creator_Suite_|URL   - http://thepiratebay.se/tor/\n10_Multilanguage (Final)\t\t|4218464/Doom_III_-_Ultimate_Co-op_\n\t\t\t\t\t\nDoom 3 Ultimate Co-op - Opencoop FINAL* |Half-Life Ultimate Co-op - Sven FINAL* \n\t\t\t\t\t|\nGame  - Complete\t\t\t|Game  - Complete\nCrack - Complete\t\t\t|Crack - Complete\nNFO   - Complete\t\t\t|NFO   - Complete\nMod   - Complete\t\t\t|Mod   - Complete\nTest  - Complete\t\t\t|Test  - Complete\nURL   - http://thepiratebay.se/tor/4218|URL   - http://thepiratebay.se/tor/ \n464/Doom_III_-_Ultimate_Co-op_(Final)   |4236344\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nHalf-Life 2 Co-op - Synergy UPD*        |Far Cry - A-C LAN Co-op FINAL*\n                                        |\nGame  - Complete\t\t\t|Game  - Complete\nCrack - Complete\t\t\t|Crack - Complete\nNFO   - Complete\t\t\t|NFO   - Complete\nTest  - Complete\t\t\t|Test  - Complete\nURL   - http://thepiratebay.se/tor/\t|URL   - http://thepiratebay.se/tor/ \n4262500/\t\t\t\t|4268119/\n\t\t\t\t\nMass Effect - Portable FINAL*\t\t|Quake 2 - Co-op UPD*\n                                        |\nGame  - Complete\t\t\t|Game  - Complete\nCrack - Complete\t\t\t|Crack - Complete\nNFO   - Complete\t\t\t|NFO   - Complete\nTest  - Complete\t\t\t|Test  - Complete\nURL   - http://thepiratebay.se/tor/\t|URL   - http://thepiratebay.se/tor/\n4274655/\t\t\t\t|4363733/\n\nDiablo 2 - Ultimate FINAL*\t\t|Civilization 2 - Ultimate FINAL*\n                                        |\nGame  - Complete\t\t\t|Game  - Complete\nCrack - Complete\t\t\t|Crack - Complete\nNFO   - Complete\t\t\t|NFO   - Complete\nTest  - Complete\t\t\t|Test  - Complete\nURL   - http://thepiratebay.se/tor/\t|URL   - Pending\n4363727/\t\t\t\t|\t\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                  Known Problems\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n(1.)
