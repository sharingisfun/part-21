But everyone at school makes fun of her for being overweight, and Troy wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t give her a second glance.\n \nBut a school assignment changes that. Laura is forced to learn the history of the slave shack on her grandmotherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s property, and she discovers she comes from a line of strong African-American women. Through understanding her roots, Laura finds the self-esteem sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been missing.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87dd6853d32ea93b205735e78e38eff3725eed38","amp;dn":"The+Laura+Line+-+Crystal+Allen.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87dd6853d32ea93b205735e78e38eff3725eed38","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,221,104,83,211,46,169,59,32,87,53,231,142,56,239,243,114,94,237,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
