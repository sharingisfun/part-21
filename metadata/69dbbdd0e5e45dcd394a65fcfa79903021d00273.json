The region\nequals out as almost the same size as\nthe United States and spans a\nhumungous 3,600,000 square miles\nacross North Africa, from the Red Sea\nto the Atlantic Ocean. Its photogenic\nundulating sandscapes have seduced\ntravellers, artists and storytellers\nfor centuries: Rudyard Kipling\ncaptured the mystery of its natural\nbeauty remarking that journeying\nthrough it up the River Nile is &quot;like\nrunning the gauntlet before\neternity&quot;.\n\nSince the ancient empires of Nubia,\nthe Great Desert has been inhabited\nconsistently: Phoenicians, Egyptians,\nGreeks, Berbers, Ottoman Turks and\nEuropean colonialists are among the\ntribes that have lived in its realms.\nAmong the Sahara's present-day\ninhabitants are nomad Fulani, Tubu\nand Tuareg peoples who recall stories\nof ancient battles forcing their\nancestors to seek refuge deep in the\ndesert where they carved out a way of\nlife, constantly moving onwards,\nrespecting the moods and winds of the\ndesert herself. Religion is largely\nIslamic in the region with cultural\nremnants of Christian, Pagan and\nJewish traditions audible in local\ndialects and behaviours.\n\nReligious and traditional factions\nacross the Sahara jostle against each\nother making for a vivid political\nlandscape, not without conflict.\nJanuary 2012 saw the beginnings of a\nTuareg uprising in northern Mali. The\nNational Movement for the Liberation\nof Azawad (MNLA) were fighting for\nautonomous powers and had taken\ncontrol of the Azawad region by April\nof the same year. A peace deal was\nsigned in June 2013 but the situation\nremains tense. Western Sahara has\nbeen listed with the United Nations\nas a case of incomplete\ndecolonization since the 1960s. The\nSaharawi national liberation\nmovement, the Polisario Front,\nformally proclaimed the Saharawi Arab\nDemocratic (SADR) in 1976 and\ncontinue to contest Morocco's power\nin the region. Gaddafi's ousting from\nthe seat of power in Libya dominated\nthe international news in 2011. In\nthe same year, Egypt's Tahrir square\nwas flooded with protesters speaking\nout in mass against then-president\nHosini Mubarak. Of course political\npassions inform musical expressions.\nEtran Finawata from Niger strive to\npromote unity - their band members\nare from both the Wodaabe and Tuareg\nethnicities which have historically\nbeen rivals. Mariem Hassan is a\nSaharawi singer whose music pays\ntribute to old poems written by Ali\nBachir and Lamin Allal, artists from\nher oppressed nation who were forced\nto live in exile. The title of her\n2012 album El Aaiun Egdat (El Aaiun\non Fire) casts a striking comment on\nthe largest city in the Western\nSahara, which is under Moroccan\noccupation.\n\nOther artists bend expectations, re-\nworking familiar pop genres into new,\nsurprising formations. Anansy Cisse\nsucks up all the brilliant things\nabout well-trodden West African\n&quot;Desert Blues&quot; trope and spits them\nout with a new, agitated attitude.\nSalamat explore Nubian elements of\nEgyptian music headed up by\npercussionist Mahmoud Fadl and Djama\nDjigui speaks a new language with his\ntamani (talking drum).\n\nnote:  includes bonus album by Mamane\nBarka!\n\nenjoy &amp; support the artists!\n\nNOiR - nubian kings ;)\n\nBiG THX to mypalGOO and HS-ART\n\nNOiR is always looking for skilled rippers!\n\nASCii  by                                           mypalGOO^HS-ART\n                          09-05-07                    ..2 o o 7","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69dbbdd0e5e45dcd394a65fcfa79903021d00273","amp;dn":"VA-The_Rough_Guide_to_the_Music_of_the_Sahara-2CD-2014-NOiR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69dbbdd0e5e45dcd394a65fcfa79903021d00273","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,219,189,208,229,228,93,205,57,74,101,252,250,121,144,48,33,208,2,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
