Having been a huge Dead fan since the first graphic novels, I have watched the enterprise turn into an outright phenomenon. Having reviewed every other incarnation of the franchise (all of the graphic novels, collectibles, and AMC's television production), I jumped at the chance to pick up this collaboration by series creator Robert Kirkman and tidy horror writer Jay Bonansinga. &quot;The Walking Dead: Rise of the Governor&quot; is an inspired idea for a novel. The Governor is one of the series' most notorious and loathsome villains--and the notion of exploring his back story will undoubtedly be appealing to fans of his dark power.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29bab05452b7265357655526c278be73a737b116","amp;dn":"Robert+Kirkman%2C+Jay+Bonansinga-The+Walking+Dead+-+Rise+of+The+Go","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29bab05452b7265357655526c278be73a737b116","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,186,176,84,82,183,38,83,87,101,85,38,194,120,190,115,167,55,177,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
