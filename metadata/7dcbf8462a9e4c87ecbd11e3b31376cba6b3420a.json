Also please seed i will only seed this for a day or two and that is it....\n\nALL THANKS GOES TO HUMANERROR FROM tehparadox And El Marto, Angelo from http://alfas.freeforums.org/\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nStart CK2 &gt;Load save &gt; Press esc &gt; Export game \n\n\nCheers!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7dcbf8462a9e4c87ecbd11e3b31376cba6b3420a","amp;dn":"Crusader+Kings+2+-+EU4+Converter+DLC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7dcbf8462a9e4c87ecbd11e3b31376cba6b3420a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,203,248,70,42,158,76,135,236,189,17,227,179,19,118,203,166,179,66,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
