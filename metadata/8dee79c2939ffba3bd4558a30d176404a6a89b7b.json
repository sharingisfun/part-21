It has been said, 'To know the story of the 47 Ronin is to know Japan.' Retold through the ages, the legend at last comes to comics in a meticulously researched and beautifully illustrated miniseries from Mike Richardson, Stan Sakai, and editorial consultant Kazuo Koike! Recounting this sweeping tale of honor and violence in all its grandeur, chapter one details the tragic incident that would seal the fate of Lord Asano and set forty-seven of his vassals on a years-long path of vengeance!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8dee79c2939ffba3bd4558a30d176404a6a89b7b","amp;dn":"47+Ronin+%231+%28of+5%29+%282012%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8dee79c2939ffba3bd4558a30d176404a6a89b7b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,238,121,194,147,159,251,163,189,69,88,163,13,23,100,4,166,168,155,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
