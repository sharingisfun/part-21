The character&amp;#039;s name is an homage to American labor and political leader Eugene V. Debs and anti-war senator Vance Hartke, both from Vonnegut&amp;#039;s home state, Indiana.\n\n\nThemes\n\nA key theme expressed in Hocus Pocus is the notion of &quot;Time and Luck&quot; -- that everything depends on past events and leads to a probable event. Vonnegut emphasizes this point throughout the book, linking events in the book to previous occurrences.\n\n\nMemorable Quotes\n\n    * Just because some of us can read and write and do a little math, that doesn&amp;#039;t mean we deserve to conquer the universe.\n\n    * That humanity is going somewhere really nice was a myth for children under 6 years old, like the tooth fairy and the Easter bunny and Santa Clause\n\n    * Another flaw in human character is that everybody wants to build and nobody wants to do maintenance. And the worst flaw is that we&amp;#039;re just plain dumb! Admit it!\n    * Rich people are poor people with money","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:359495bffa99a7a2f4eb17efd5d05cc6767ecab4","amp;dn":"Kurt+Vonnegut+-+Hocus+Pocus+%28unabridged%2C+96kBit%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"359495bffa99a7a2f4eb17efd5d05cc6767ecab4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,148,149,191,250,153,167,162,244,235,23,239,213,208,92,198,118,126,202,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
