In RÃƒÂ©surrection people are re-incarnated into monsters according to the sins - or lack thereof - of their life. The lowest ranks are formed by zombies and Kobolds whilst vampires form the elite of the society and the ruling class. The more cruel one was in life, the better he is rewarded on RÃƒÂ©surrection. There is therefore an inverted concept of justice in &quot;Requiem Chevalier Vampire&quot;. RÃƒÂ©surrection has a similar shape as our Earth does, but everything appears to be the opposite way around than on Earth. Land has replaced the oceans, while seas of perpetual fire occupy our known continents and time flows backwards. People do not get older but rejuvenate until they become a foetus and ultimately are forgotten; their memory follows the same cycle and is &quot;lost&quot; as people get younger. In order to avoid madness and total loss of their mind in this process, RÃƒÂ©surrection's residents are addicted to a drug based on black opium. People do not land on RÃƒÂ©surrection in the same order that they died (for instance, Requiem died before Otto and Claudia but landed on RÃƒÂ©surrection after them).\n\nThe hero is a German soldier during World War II named Heinrich Augsburg, who is killed on the Eastern Front facing the Soviet Army. He is sent to RÃƒÂ©surrection after his death and is attacked by a mob of zombies. During the confrontation he meets a vampire who calls himself Otto von Todt and befriends him. Otto reveals he is a vampire and explains that now Heinrich has become a vampire as well. As the story progresses, the hero discovers the world of RÃƒÂ©surrection, its peoples and politics. He is however only interested in retrieving a woman he loved during his lifetime and who he knows by the name of Rebecca.\n\nThis is part 7.
