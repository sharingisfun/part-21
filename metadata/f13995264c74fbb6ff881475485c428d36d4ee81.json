Reading it to page 7 should give you a complete idea if you can stomach the kind of writing, although the later topics are more interesting than the intro. I would instantly trade all the political bias or kids get drilled in school for an opportunity for them to read this.\n\nQuotes:\n\nThis is meant as refreshment if you are getting sick of the fluffy stream of &quot;info&quot; telling you paradise is around the corner, and saviors are stomping all over each other on their way to rescue us from our every trouble. Not to forget the preachers trumpeting, how a certain shady figure or techno gadget is responsible for all the troubles in the world, then dissecting their lineage tree. Either way the increasing number of Ã¢â‚¬Å“enlighteningÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ materials floating about is seriously stinking lately, even if conspiracy is not in your vocabulary. You know the drill - Ã¢â‚¬Å“Vote for us, give us your moneys, pray at our temples - just do as we tell you and we'll give you paradise, SUBSCRIBE NOW! and get the free penis enlargement program for free as well! You don't have to lift a finger; Jesus will do this, Moses that, technology the other thing and then vote us in office and we will take care of the rest!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ ((:\n\nThis is anything but some humane generous act of revelation, or any other type of Ã¢â‚¬Å“sweetenedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ candy giveaway, the least of which is some supposedly profound truth presented to you with the claim or slimy suggestions yelling silently that itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s relevant and/or valuable information that you need to believe\n\nThe shit in here isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t tucked under the rug or dressed up like a commercial flick where you get 50 friends by just chewing the right brand of bubble-gum. So, if you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want it on you - DO, mind your step.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f13995264c74fbb6ff881475485c428d36d4ee81","amp;dn":"A+Fool+Walking-through+Enlightened+Bullshit+R8","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f13995264c74fbb6ff881475485c428d36d4ee81","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,57,149,38,76,116,251,182,255,136,20,117,72,92,66,141,54,212,238,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
