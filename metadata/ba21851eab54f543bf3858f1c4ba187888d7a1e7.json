The book concludes with a chapter called Ã¢â‚¬Å“How I Created It,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ in which the author provides a behind-the-scenes look at more than a dozen shoots, demonstrating in a comprehensive way how all the previous principles come into play on real assignments.\n\nabout author :-\n\nRichard Young is a fine art and commercial photographer.
