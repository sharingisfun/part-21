Aibileen (Davis), Skeeter's best friend's housekeeper, is the first to open up -- to the dismay of her friends in the tight-knit black community. Despite Skeeter's life-long friendships hanging in the balance, she and Aibileen continue their collaboration and soon more women come forward to tell their stories -- and as it turns out, they have a lot to say. Along the way, unlikely friendships are forged and a new sisterhood emerges, but not before everyone in town has a thing or two to say themselves when they become unwittingly -- and unwillingly -- caught up in the changing times.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c8f0968d9841bc51dcfc84ff099011b4b2f7713f","amp;dn":"The+Help+%282011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c8f0968d9841bc51dcfc84ff099011b4b2f7713f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,240,150,141,152,65,188,81,220,252,132,255,9,144,17,180,178,247,113,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
