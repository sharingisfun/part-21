Unlike other animated series based on Bible stories, these programs are not based on modern characters interacting with Biblical figures, but rather provide dramatic retelling of the Bible stories themselves. The series was created to be a non-denominational informative and educational tool to help parents, caregivers, and educators instill positive spiritual values and character traits to those in their care.\n\n\nThe series was directed by Richard Rich, the ex-Disney director who also directed The Swan Princess trilogy, and other animated educational programs such as the Animated Hero Classics and the K10C: KidsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Ten Commandments.\n\n01 Abraham &amp; Isaac\n02 Joseph in Egypt\n03 Samuel the Boy Prophet\n04 Elijah\n05 Daniel\n06 Esther\n07 Moses From Birth to Burning Bush\n08 Elisha Man of God\n09 The Story of Ruth\n10 David and Goliath\n11 Solomon\n12 JosephÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Reunion\n13 The King is born\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:094458b709e57955a4cbf8bcbb05572671bea336","amp;dn":"Animated+Stories+from+the+Old+Testament","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"094458b709e57955a4cbf8bcbb05572671bea336","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,68,88,183,9,229,121,85,164,203,248,188,187,5,87,38,113,190,163,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
