Do you like the crime fighter The Question?\n\nIf yes, this 106 page FANEDIT of Detective Comics Pipeline should be very enjoyable. Pipeline consists of 2 chapters and spans 11 issues of Detective Comics from 854 (2009-08) to 865 (2010-07). Pipeline follows up on Renee's big adventure with The Spectre, her former partner Crispus Allen, in Final Crisis: Revelations (2007-2008). Pipeline shows Renee again traveling the world to combat slavers and finally encounter a terrible old enemy. The Huntress (Helena Bertinelli) joins up with Renee and battles along her side to the end. As is typical, Renee leaves Helena to ponder a final tantalizing Question at the end. This is the last of Renee's starring roles in the Pre-Flashpoint New Earth era - hopefully DC will bring Renee back soon.\n\nPlease check out other DC Comics plus Battlestar Galactica, Rifftrax, Star Trek Enterprise, documentaries and more at:\n &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/bsg4you/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/bsg4you/&lt;/a&gt;  \nand leave any corrections, criticism, comments and requests.\n\nThanks, bsg4you","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed758dd093eafb4587ca67ce8bd048a8e663d97b","amp;dn":"Detective+Comics+854-865+Pipeline+Renee+Montoya+FANEDIT+digital","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed758dd093eafb4587ca67ce8bd048a8e663d97b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,117,141,208,147,234,251,69,135,202,103,206,139,208,72,168,230,99,217,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
