And look, there's three other such types JUST like you in here. What are the odds? Perhaps it was destiny. Perhaps you were meant to meet these strangers: a Rogue, a Mage, a Priest...\r\n\r\nWait, a Rogue? No, you can't trust a thief with all that Treasure around. That's just plain ridiculous. Maybe let's go talk to another Warrior type like yourself. Now that I think about it, you've got nothing in common with the Mage or Priest. What'll you discuss? Boring stuff, most likely.\r\n\r\nMaybe we don't need the Mage, then. Maybe add that other Warrior type over there, hitting on the barman. She looks pretty strong. She'll help get a lot of treasure","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:556bd7345d70dd2f1f5f2ec0b6492930fd671e4e","amp;dn":"Zavix+Tower+v1.26b","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"556bd7345d70dd2f1f5f2ec0b6492930fd671e4e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,107,215,52,93,112,221,47,31,95,46,192,182,73,41,48,253,103,30,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
