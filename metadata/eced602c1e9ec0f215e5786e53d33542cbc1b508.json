I've remastered them the best I could.\nThe result is less than satisfactory, but it's as good as it gets. Sorry.\n\nThe 1977 album was downloaded from an unknown source.\nMost probably ripped from one of the CD re-issues, as it includes\nthe re-recorded &quot;Roxy roller&quot; single with Bryan Adam's vocals,\nalong with it's B-side (&quot;Rue de Chance&quot;) as bonus tracks.\n\nThis is pretty much a complete collection of the band.\nYou can burn the whole thing on a single audio-CD if you like.\nJust remember NOT to normalize the tracks and to use NO GAPS\nbetween tracks. The disc should be fine, totalizing 79'17&quot;.\nI've included here a possible CD cover that I made which can be\nprinted to be inserted on a standard CD jewel case\nif you like.\n\nEnjoy!\n=]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eced602c1e9ec0f215e5786e53d33542cbc1b508","amp;dn":"Sweeney+Todd+Discography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eced602c1e9ec0f215e5786e53d33542cbc1b508","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,237,96,44,30,158,192,242,21,229,120,110,83,211,53,66,203,193,181,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
