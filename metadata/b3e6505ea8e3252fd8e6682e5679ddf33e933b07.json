Based around their â€˜On The Beach With The Paragonsâ€™ album and augmented with a CD and a halfâ€™s worth of bonus tracks. \r\n\r\nIncludes the seminal â€˜The Tide Is Highâ€™. In 1998, the French Jet Set label reissued this classic 1967 album on CD. The original art work was included along with informative new liner notes and write-ups on both the Paragons and Duke &quot;the Trojan&quot; Reid (founder of the Kingston-based Treasure Isle Records and an important figure in Jamaican music). Originally a Treasure Isle LP, On the Beach with the Paragons sold well in Jamaica and also became a hit in England (where reggae and ska have been huge since the '60s).\r\n\r\nOne of reggae's finest vocal harmony groups of the '60s, the Paragons were the reggae equivalent of soulsters like the Four Tops, the Delfonics and the Miracles â€“ and it's impossible to miss the northern soul influence on such gems as &quot;Island in the Sun,&quot; &quot;Happy-Go-Lucky Girl,&quot; &quot;Only a Smile&quot; and their most famous hit, &quot;The Tide Is High&quot; (which Blondie covered with splendid results in 1980). \r\n\r\nThe Paragons' charismatic lead singer, John Holt, has inspired comparisons to Bob Marley â€“ to be sure, there was some similarity, but Holt was certainly his own man. Not only is On the Beach essential listening for reggae enthusiasts, it's also a CD that lovers of vocal-group soul can appreciate.\r\n\r\nCD1\r\n01 - On The Beach\r\n02 - Island In The Sun\r\n03 - When The Lights Are Low\r\n04 - The Tide Is High\r\n05 - Love Brings Pain\r\n06 - Only A Smile\r\n07 - I'll Be Back\r\n08 - Happy Go Lucky Girl\r\n09 - Yellow Bird\r\n10 - I' Ll Be Back\r\n11 - Talking Love\r\n12 - We Were Meant To Be\r\n13 - Mercy Mercy Mercy\r\n14 - The Same Song\r\n15 - You Mean The World To Me\r\n16 - Riding A High And Windy Day\r\n17 - A Silver Bird\r\n18 - My Best Girl\r\n19 - (I'm A) Worried Man\r\n20 - The Land Of Sun And Sea\r\n21 - Memories By The Score\r\n22 - The Number One For Me\r\n23 - Left With A Broken Heart\r\n24 - I've Got To Get Away\r\n25 - Equality And Justice\r\n26 - You Mean So Much To Me\r\n27 - Maybe Someday\r\n28 - I Want To Be With You\r\n29 - On The Beach (Medley)\r\n\r\nCD2\r\n01 - Blackbird Singing (Feat.
