But itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not our story. Ours is a lot more colorful.When I met Dee I knew right away that she was special. When she met me, she thought I was anything but specialÃ¢â‚¬â€I was exactly like every other guy whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d screwed her over and let her down. It took some time to convince her otherwise, but turns out I can make a convincing argument when sex is at stake.You might know where this storyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s headed. But the best part isn't where we ended up ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s how we got there.TAMED goes back in time to the Tangled days. But this time around, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not Drew dishing out the advice and opinionsÃ¢â‚¬â€itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s his best friend Matthew, who of course is dealing with Dee Dee.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3d42595507fe54fee60e818c96aa67e99b540b7","amp;dn":"Emma+Chase-Tamed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a3d42595507fe54fee60e818c96aa67e99b540b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,212,37,149,80,127,229,79,238,96,232,24,201,106,166,126,153,181,64,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
