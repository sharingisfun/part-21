The two-disc compilation features thirty-eight hit songs by Michael Jackson, from his days at Motown Records with The Jackson 5 in the late 1960s to his 2001 hit &quot;You Rock My World&quot;. It was released on July 19, 2005 in the United States (released a day earlier in the United Kingdom). On August 26, 2008, The Essential Michael Jackson 3.0 was released in the US as a Limited Edition containing an additional disc of seven songs performed by Jackson. A re-titled release in the UK was planned on July 6, 2009 as &quot;The Hits,&quot; but was cancelled upon Jackson's death. As of 2009 the album was certified 2x platinum in the US, it's estimated that over 7 million copies have been sold worldwide, making it the highest selling edition in Sony's Essential line. It entered the UK Albums Chart at #2 and sold over 200,000 copies in five months. \n\nRob Theakston, All Music Guide - There are several Michael Jackson greatest-hits compilations out there, each one its own take on what should be the definitive portrait of the gloved one's career. The Ultimate Collection, The Essential Collection (different from the one here), and Number Ones have all surfaced in 2003 and 2004, and HIStory a few years prior. Each one of these collections, while commendable in its attempt to thoroughly document Jackson's accomplishments, has fallen woefully short in one aspect or another. This has finally been rectified with this installment of Sony's outstanding Essential collection. Starting with his campaign with his brothers in the Jackson 5, this two-disc set tours through every important single and every important fan favorite short of including his duet with Paul McCartney on &quot;Say Say Say&quot; (the Beatle does, however, make an appearance here on &quot;The Girl Is Mine&quot;). From Off the Wall to Dangerous, it's all here in one concise package, making it the ideal reference point from which exploration into his deeper catalog can begin. While die-hard fans will already have every single song contained herein and may be weary to purchase another greatest-hits compilation short of a greatest-hits compilation including his backing vocals on Rockwell's &quot;Somebody's Watching Me,&quot; this may be the only one fans and casual listeners will ever have to purchase to get their fill of the King of Pop's magic. ~ \n\n\nDisc 01\n\n[01] I Want You Back              \tJackson 5\n[02] ABC                     \tJackson 5\n[03] The Love You Save         \tJackson 5\n[04] Got To Be There            \tMichael Jackson (Single Version)\n[05] Rockin' Robin             \tMichael Jackson\n[06] Ben                     \tMichael Jackson (Single Version)\n[07] Blame It On The Boogie \tThe Jackson\n[08] Shake Your Body         \tMichael Jackson (Single Edit)\n[09] Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough \tMichael Jackson (2003 Edit)\n[10] Off The Wall             \tMichael Jackson (Single Version)\n[11] Rock With You\tMichael           Jackson (Single Version)\n[12] She's Out Of My Life         \tMichael Jackson (Single Version)\n[13] Can You Feel It            \tMichael Jackson (Single Version)\n[14] The Girl Is Mine            \tMichael Jackson &amp; Paul McCartney\n[15] Billie Jean             \tMichael Jackson\n[16] Beat It                  \tMichael Jackson\n[17] Wanna Be Startin' Somethin' \tMichael Jackson (Single Version)\n[18] Human Nature                \tMichael Jackson\n[19] P.Y.T.
