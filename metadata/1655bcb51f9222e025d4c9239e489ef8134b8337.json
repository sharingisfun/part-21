In this show he looks at consumer-focused topics, such as civil liberties, the business of health care, and free trade.\n\n_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2\n\nTHAT'S SO HARD!\n\nFriday at 8PM ET on FBN\n\nWhen you deal with government, almost nothing is easy. Here's our show:\n\nTHAT WAS EASY!\n\nGovernment could take a lesson from Staples. When Staples changed its business model and worked at making shopping simple, its profit went up 18% and its share price increased $37% because its customers were happier. But when consumers deal with government, few are happy, and little is simple.\n\nSAVINGS BONDS: It should be easy to buy a savings bond. Billions were sold (they helped pay for WWII); but now government makes it so difficult!\n\nPOLITICAL SPEECH: Are these guys running for president?\n\nOf course they are! Everyone knows it, but they won't admit it because if they do, bureaucrats subject them to all sorts of restrictions and strangle their fundraising.\n\nHIRING HASSLE: With politicians' talk about job creation, you would hope government would make it easy to hire people. But the opposite is true. There are a thousand questions you may not ask when hiring someone... &quot;how long have you been working?&quot; or &quot;how tall are you?&quot; could get you into big trouble.\n\nLICENSING LIABILITIES: Politicians also kill opportunity by forcing entrepreneurs to run through a maze of licensing laws.\n\nINSANE GUN LAWS: Since people sometimes threaten to kill me, I thought it would be a good idea to get a gun. NYC's government makes that hard.\n\nSTOSSEL IN THE CLASSROOM: I run an essay contest for my non-profit organization. This year's winner is Raelynn Rhodes, who wrote about the burden of regulation on her dog treat business. She writes: &quot;In a free economy, if I made a bad dog treat, word would have spread, and people would not have continued to buy them. Wouldn't that be a simple way to weed out people who make bad dog treats?&quot;\n\nMY TAKE: For bureaucrats, the maze of regulations works. It makes them powerful. But for the rest of us, it makes life hard!\n\n_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2\n\nGeneral\nComplete name                            : Stossel.2015.06.12.Its.So.Hard.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO.mp4\nFormat                                   : MPEG-4\nFormat profile                           : Base Media\nCodec ID                                 : isom\nFile size                                : 348 MiB\nDuration                                 : 40mn 58s\nOverall bit rate                         : 1 189 Kbps\nWriting application                      : Lavf56.25.101\n\nVideo\nID                                       : 1\nFormat                                   : AVC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                           : High@L3\nFormat settings, CABAC                   : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames                : 4 frames\nCodec ID                                 : avc1\nCodec ID/Info                            : Advanced Video Coding\nDuration                                 : 40mn 58s\nBit rate                                 : 1 050 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 624 pixels\nHeight                                   : 364 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 1.714\nFrame rate mode                          : Variable\nFrame rate                               : 29.970 fps\nMinimum frame rate                       : 9.990 fps\nMaximum frame rate                       : 29.970 fps\nColor space                              : YUV\nChroma subsampling                       : 4:2:0\nBit depth                                : 8 bits\nScan type                                : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)                       : 0.154\nStream size                              : 308 MiB (88%)\nWriting library                          : x264 core 142 r2389 956c8d8\nEncoding settings                        : cabac=1 / ref=3 / deblock=1:0:0 / analyse=0x3:0x133 / me=hex / subme=7 / psy=1 / psy_rd=1.00:0.00 / mixed_ref=1 / me_range=16 / chroma_me=1 / trellis=1 / 8x8dct=1 / cqm=0 / deadzone=21,11 / fast_pskip=1 / chroma_qp_offset=-2 / threads=6 / lookahead_threads=1 / sliced_threads=0 / nr=0 / decimate=1 / interlaced=0 / bluray_compat=0 / constrained_intra=0 / bframes=3 / b_pyramid=2 / b_adapt=1 / b_bias=0 / direct=1 / weightb=1 / open_gop=0 / weightp=2 / keyint=250 / keyint_min=25 / scenecut=40 / intra_refresh=0 / rc_lookahead=40 / rc=2pass / mbtree=1 / bitrate=1050 / ratetol=1.0 / qcomp=0.60 / qpmin=10 / qpmax=51 / qpstep=4 / cplxblur=20.0 / qblur=0.5 / ip_ratio=1.40 / aq=1:1.00\n\nAudio\nID                                       : 2\nFormat                                   : AAC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat profile                           : LC\nCodec ID                                 : 40\nDuration                                 : 40mn 58s\nBit rate mode                            : Constant\nBit rate                                 : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nChannel positions                        : Front: L R\nSampling rate                            : 48.0 KHz\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nStream size                              : 37.5 MiB (11%)\nLanguage                                 : unk","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1655bcb51f9222e025d4c9239e489ef8134b8337","amp;dn":"Stossel.2015.06.12.Its.So.Hard.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1655bcb51f9222e025d4c9239e489ef8134b8337","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,85,188,181,31,146,34,224,37,212,201,35,158,72,158,248,19,75,131,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
