The last five years have shown a paradigm shift toward the adoption of robotic surgical techniques by private and academic institutions alike.\n\nThis transition has been driven by an increasingly educated patient population who seek out less morbid ways to address their disease. The introduction of this new technology has allowed for a significant advancement in patient care. By providing a minimally invasive surgical option, patient recovery is faster with comparable outcomes to open surgical techniques.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4363dcdb7f050dce9b0d1b876c0916a4c89e54be","amp;dn":"Urologic+Robotic+Surgery+-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4363dcdb7f050dce9b0d1b876c0916a4c89e54be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,99,220,219,127,5,13,206,155,13,27,135,108,9,22,164,200,158,84,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
