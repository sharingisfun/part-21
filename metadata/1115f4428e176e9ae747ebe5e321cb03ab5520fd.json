In the 1980s, he worked at MCA for nine years. He has since done remastering work for companies such as Digital Compact Classics (DCC) and Audio Fidelity, Analogue Productions, Rural Rhythm and, presently, S&amp;P.\n\n\nIn his early years Steve Hoffman worked in radio and earned a degree in mass communications from California State University, Northridge.[1] Later, he went to work for MCA where he would compile running orders for Greatest Hits albums. Disappointed about the quality of many early compilations, he made it a priority to seek out the original master tapes rather than later copies for the releases he was working on.[2]\n\nThe first CD Steve Hoffman remastered was &quot;For The First Time Anywhere&quot; by Buddy Holly, which consists of ten early undubbed recordings.\n\nHis approach to remastering is a minimalist one, often eschewing many common processing steps in order to present a true representation of the original master tapes. He attains this by avoiding compression, limiting, equalization and noise reduction\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRock The First ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Volume Five \n\n\n\nTracks \n\nWhats Love Got To Do With It ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Tina Turner\nMissing You ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ John Waite\nElection Day ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Arcadia\nWhen IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m With You ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Sheriff\nTake My Breath Away ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Berlin\nLife In A Northern Town ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Dream Academy\nEvery Rose Has Its Thorn ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Poison\nHold On To The Nights ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Richard Marx\nSuddenly Last Summer ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ The Motels\nI Can Dream About You ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Dan Hartman\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1115f4428e176e9ae747ebe5e321cb03ab5520fd","amp;dn":"Rock+The+First+-+Vol.5+%28S.+Hoffman+Remaster%29+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1115f4428e176e9ae747ebe5e321cb03ab5520fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,21,244,66,142,23,110,154,231,71,235,229,227,33,203,3,171,85,32,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
