His grief keeps him awake and pushes Uhura away. Kirk is awake too, talking to the computer because he lacks companionship. Both arrive on the bridge ahead of schedule for a routine mission, scanning a pre-industrial society on Phaedus. A high frequency energy field from the planetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s surface disrupts communications and the transporter. Kirk, Spock, Sulu and Hendorff take a shuttle to investigate and are attacked with energy weapons. Sulu is seriously injured when the shuttle goes down. Armed with weapons they shouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have and an older model Starfleet tricorder, the natives of Phaedus demand identification. Kirk, in turn, demands to know where they got their weapons. Robert April, a former captain of the Enterprise answers. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c81d7ac555bea7170f824c31d69c90a207cee67","amp;dn":"Star+Trek+Countdown+To+Darkness+1+-+January+2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c81d7ac555bea7170f824c31d69c90a207cee67","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,129,215,172,85,91,234,113,112,248,36,195,29,105,201,10,32,124,238,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
