Each of the 313 species is described thoroughly and accurately, and every plumage and variation is shown in more than two thousand color illustrations plus hundreds of black-and-white drawings. Both large-scale and small-scale range maps show in detail where each species has been found.\nLike all the other identification guides in the Helm series Ã¢â‚¬â€ including Seabirds, Shorebirds, Warblers of the Americas, Waterfowl, Woodpeckers, and Sparrows and Buntings Ã¢â‚¬â€ Raptors is the definitive book on its subject. The birds of prey are arguably the most fascinating group of birds for birders and nonbirders alike, and Raptors will be an essential reference for anyone with an interest in birds.&quot;\n\n\n\n------\nSee more of my eTorrents at &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/sweEpub&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/sweEpub&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46652a5f300a389e8d9f26857043d37cfeb9b7b7","amp;dn":"Raptors+of+the+World+-+%5BPDF%5D%5BsweEpub%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46652a5f300a389e8d9f26857043d37cfeb9b7b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,101,42,95,48,10,56,158,141,159,38,133,112,67,211,124,254,185,183,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
