Founded in Canton, Mississippi, the original group included the songwriter and singer, Harvey Watkins, Sr., who began to sing in the group at the age of fourteen, and the other original members: Eddie Jackson, Theo Thompson, and Roscoe Lucious. The Canton Spirituals has remained the number one gospel music quartet in the country. They represent the best of the past and present in gospel music.\n\nThe Canton Spirituals - booking information The current lead singer, Harvey Watkins, Jr. has been singing and performing with the group since he was a young child. Watkins attributes his interest in music to his parents. Watkins' father and mother are still the most important persons in his life. Since The Canton Spirituals' founding, they have been through heartaches and pains and many people have left the group.\n\nThe current Canton Spirituals members are under the direction of Harvey Watkins, Jr., since the passing of his father, Harvey Watkins, Sr., who died of cancer in Jackson, Mississippi, on November 16, 1994. Harvey Watkins, Sr., until his death, was the only original member with the Canton Spirituals. In the city of Canton, Watkins's song-writing skills, music and legacy will remain an important part of, not just the city of Canton's history, but America's history also.\n\nIn July 1994, Watkins received a Legend Award at the Mississippi Gospel Music Awards. During the same month, Second Street in Canton, Mississippi, was renamed Harvey Watkins, Sr., Street in his honor. The Canton Spirituals have always kept God as the cornerstone of their life and music. Their music, according to one source, reflects the &quot;heart&quot; and &quot;soul&quot; of this rich genre and is perhaps the primary reason why they have such a loyal following. The Canton Spirituals have received numerous awards due to their dynamic and melancholic music.\n\nIn Harvey Watkins' hometown of Canton, Mississippi, The Canton Spirituals received a Concurrent Resolution 557 in February from the Mississippi Legislature during their 1998 Regular Session honoring them for receiving two Stellar Awards at the 1997 Stellar Gospel Music Awards and for being the only gospel quartet in America and the only Mississippi gospel artist to achieve such honors.\n\nThe Canton Spirituals have also received the 1998 Excellence Award for Quartet of the Year - Traditional and LP of the Year - Traditional. The Canton Spirituals have also won Group/Duo of the Year and Traditional group/duo at the thirteenth annual Stellar Awards. Their album, &quot;Live in Memphis I,&quot; received a Grammy nomination. They appeared at the awards\n\nBelow are 2 Local Favorites and 7 Gospel Groups that performed at the The Gospel Tent at The New Orleans Jazz Festival this year, 2011.

Solved\n\n\nThis is dedicated to my Mom who passed at 11:44 pm PST ON 1-25-2011. Now she knows.\n\nPOtHS 3 - Conspiracy Facts - Part 99 - The Greatest Conspiracy of All Times - Solved\n- NO MORE DOUBTS - Coming Soon\n\nJESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.\n\nBorn of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\nRAPtURE (My transportation outta here).\n\nThe Blessed Hope.  If you believe in The Rapture you better believe The Above Statement and that the Sacrificed Blood of Jesus, on the Cross paid for your sins and there is NOTHING Else you can do to gain Salvation, The GRACE of Christ did it ALL. Now you just have to believe that with all your Heart, Mind and Soul or Maybe Get Left Behind. All PAST, Present and Future Sins are Forgiven with Jesus. (I wouldn't PUSH That Future sin statement to much!!!)\n\nIn a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed...\n\n&quot;And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.\n\n&quot;Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,  Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in The Air, and there we will be forever be with him...hmmm sounds like some of us might be Immortal. (Ask your preacher about that)\n\nThis is what is coming and more. If you do not believe in The Rapture and Jesus, you will need to Study The Below Survival videos.\n\nMore Torrents in this series atALL TORRENTS are RELEASED here FIRST!!!
