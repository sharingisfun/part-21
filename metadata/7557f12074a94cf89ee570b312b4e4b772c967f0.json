The authorsâ€™ latest research findings, based on dimensional analyses, well-instrumented full-scale field tests, systematic coupled-consolidation finite element analyses and centrifuge tests are reported. This book shows how to systematically approach a complex geotechnical problem, from identifying existing problems, reviewing literature, to dimensional and numerical analyses, validation through full-scale testing and centrifuge model testing. The methodologies are also introduced as major tools adopted in geotechnical research","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7557f12074a94cf89ee570b312b4e4b772c967f0","amp;dn":"Deformation+and+Failure+Mechanism+of+Excavation+in+Clay+Subjecte","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7557f12074a94cf89ee570b312b4e4b772c967f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,87,241,32,116,169,76,248,158,229,112,179,18,180,228,183,114,201,103,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
