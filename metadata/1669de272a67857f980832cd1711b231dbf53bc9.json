Recorded in Hamburg in 2001 and with guest musicians who played on The Sea and with Tom Waits and Lou Reed, this cd has many odd, exotic intruments such as pump organs, celestes and whistles among others. 18 songs of religion and mortality on one album, our 15th studio album finds us walking hand in hand with Death and Jesus.\nReview by David McComb of Bizare Magazine\n\nRecorded around the same time as their moody epic The Sea, Death And The Bible is a world away from the gleeful perversity and kinky stompers of the LilliesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ last album Punch &amp; Judy, instead finding the twisted trio in a more sombre and reflective mood.\nAs the title suggests, Death... focuses on the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s favourite themes of decline and religion, from the tragic subject of Incontinent who wishes for death to escape the body that is rebelling against him, to Mary Magdalena who shagged Roman centurions, fishermen, thieves and even &quot;had that Jesus Christ&quot;.\nWhile the record isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t nearly as much fun as PunchÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ or the LilliesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢early albums, DeathÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ nonetheless creates a dark, melancholy atmosphere and beautifully captures the mood of seeing the band play live (without the inflatable sheep, pig masks or greasepaint, of course).
