Dishel was frontman of the New York City band Stipplicon, lead guitarist for The Moldy Peaches and is currently pursuing his individual project Only Son. When playing as a full band, Only Son includes Rick Snell on guitar, Shawn Feeney on bass, Jesse Wallace on drums and Jon Natchez/Ryan Smith on keyboards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnly Son\n\nOnly Son is the band name of NYC-based songwriter Jack Dishel. Born in Moscow and raised from early childhood in New York, Dishel has been releasing records and playing in New York bands since the late 1990s. Only Son's first album, &quot;The Drop To The Top&quot; was released in 2006 and features eleven songs, including &quot;My Museum&quot;, &quot;Long Live The Future&quot;, &quot;Sleepyface&quot; and &quot;Brand New Broken Heart&quot;. He toured the world in support of the album for two years opening for Regina Spektor and former bandmate Adam Green. The second Only Son album, titled &quot;Searchlight&quot;, was released January 18, 2011 and features &quot;Magic&quot;, whose video was directed by Adria Petty. It can be seen on Only Son's YouTube channel.\n\nBefore creating Only Son, Dishel released two albums under the name Stipplicon - &quot;Stipplicon&quot; (1999) and &quot;The Late Great Truth&quot; (2001). A song from the second album, &quot;Stamp Your Name On It&quot; was featured on the Anti-Folk: Volume 1 compilation (Rough Trade). Since then, Dishel has re-recorded that and other songs from the Stipplicon catalog for Only Son albums, and has expressed a desire to continue doing this in the future. &quot;I still really like a lot of those songs,&quot; he says, &quot;and most people have never heard them. Plus I can make them sound better now - closer to how I originally imagined they would be. It'll be nice to give them a second chance to make a first impression...&quot;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Dishel&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Dishel&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.
