Just check the logfiles and see for yourself. If it&amp;#039;s not flawlessly ripped and confidence checked against multiple drives, I don&amp;#039;t release it.\n\n:: Notes on Lossy Releases:\n\nMy lossy releases use one of my personal favorite codecs (the latest tested build of either LAME-APS or NDAAC) and are made with the same attention to quality as my lossless (FLAC) releases. I make these releases for those who want a quick download and are not in need of the bit-for-bit archival benefits of a lossless release, but still desire for transparent quality in their lossy music library. These are &quot;special&quot; releases that are a departure from my normal (lossless) NEORIP release scheme, and are typically made for rarer albums that have a lack of existing releases. They are provided as an &quot;extra service,&quot; if you will. Enjoy. :)\n\n:: Other Notes:\nThere will be a lossless (FLAC) release of this album at a later time. If you are looking for a bit-for-bit identical (burnable) archive of the original, wait for that release.\n\n:: NEORIP\n:: The new age of music sharing.
