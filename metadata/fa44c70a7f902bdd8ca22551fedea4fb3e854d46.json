But the set also finds room for other post-punk heavyweights and lesser-knowns (Cabaret Voltaire, A Certain Ratio, Section 25, the Wake, Quando Quango), Madchester staples (Happy Mondays, Northside), and even a few folks who would go on to bigger things (OMD, James). There through it all is perhaps the imprintÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s one true constant, the Durutti Column, who gets a track on each of the four discs.\n\n\nFactory buffs may notice the conspicuous absence in the tracklist below of ESG, who are reportedly not included here due to licensing issues.\n\n\nA Factory Box Set commemorates the 30th anniversary of Factory RecordsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ 1978 founding.\n\nUploader: Wish-man\nCat.Number of Uplaod: wishfac13","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa44c70a7f902bdd8ca22551fedea4fb3e854d46","amp;dn":"V%2FA+-+2009+-+Factory+Records%3A+Communications+1978-92","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa44c70a7f902bdd8ca22551fedea4fb3e854d46","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,68,199,10,127,144,43,221,140,162,37,81,254,222,164,251,62,133,77,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
