For these reasons, we have been satisfied and have seen no reason for change.&quot; Robert Cameron, Samford University\n\n&quot;Chapter 9 is well organized and includes an appropriate selection of material given the overall topic. The in-chapter problems are well chosen and presented in a timely manner. The illustrations are helpful and there are lots of end-of-chapter problems for students to work.&quot; Steven Holmgren, Montana State University\n\n&quot;Chapter 17 is an excellent chapterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦. It seems as though the author has a particular fondness for this topic that shows in his thoughtful and entertaining handling of the subject matter. The use of color to help students follow the transfer of atoms and pieces of molecules during catalytic reactions in this chapter is very effective. The author is also commended for his frequent reminders to the reader that these biological processes are comprised of organic reactions that they have studied earlier in the book.&quot; Alvan C. Hengge, Utah State University --This text refers to the Hardcover edition.\nProduct Description\nThe Study Guide/Solutions Manual contains answers to all problems in the text.
