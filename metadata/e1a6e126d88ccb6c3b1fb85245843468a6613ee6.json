It is structured as a relay race, in which a person, a thing or something out of a scene brings the audience into another scene with new people and events.\n\nOut of this emerges a kaleidoscopic story of both daily occurrences and dramatic situations, which in an entertaining and ironic way acts as a commentary on the Faroese, foreigners in the islands, as well as Faroese society in general.\n\nAtlantic Rhapsody is the first feature film ever to be produced in the Faroes. It is a no-budget film made against all odds for 1.7 mio.
