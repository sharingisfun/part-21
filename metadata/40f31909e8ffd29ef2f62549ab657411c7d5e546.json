The aim of computer graphics is to visualize real objects and imaginary or other abstract items. In order to visualize various things, many technologies are necessary and they are mainly divided into two types in computer graphics: modeling and rendering technologies. This book covers the most advanced technologies for both types. It also includes some visualization techniques and applications for motion blur, virtual agents and historical textiles. This book provides useful insights for researchers in computer graphics.\n\nENJOY AND SEED!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40f31909e8ffd29ef2f62549ab657411c7d5e546","amp;dn":"Computer+Graphics+-+2010kaiser","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40f31909e8ffd29ef2f62549ab657411c7d5e546","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,243,25,9,232,255,210,158,242,246,37,73,171,101,116,17,199,213,229,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
