As Jon Bon Jovi later stated:\nWhen I was writing &quot;It's My Life&quot;, I thought I was writing very self-indulgently about my own life and where I was in it. I didn't realize that the phrase &quot;It's My Life&quot; would be taken as being about everyone--by teenagers, by older guys, mechanics, whatever. &quot;It's my life, and I'm taking control&quot;. Everyone kind of feels that way from time to time.\n\n    Pop Evil is an American rock band that was formed in Grand Rapids, Michigan in 2001 by Leigh Kakaty.
