Soon they realize they may be at the motel for another reason when one by one, people start getting killed off. As tensions flare and fingers are pointed, they have to get to the bottom of why they're there. Meanwhile in an undisclosed location, a psychiatrist is trying to prove the innocence of a man accused of murder in an eleventh hour trial. How these two through-lines are related can only be found in Identity.\n-Written by mystic80-\n\nSource-------- EUR BD / AVC @28 MBps\nReleased------ 2013/09/27\nFormat-------- Matroska/h264\nFile size----- 4.47 GB\nLength-------- 1:30:02\nVideo Bit rate 6.2 MBps\nDisplay AR---- 1920/800 (2.40:1)\nFrame rate---- 23.976 fps\nAudio--------- DTS 5.1 @768\nSubtitles----- Eng, Chi (2), Cro, Dan, Dut, Fin, Fre, Ger, Hun, \n               Ind, Nor, Pt-br, Rom, Rus, Slv, Spa, Srp, Swe, Tur\nScreens------- http://imgbox.com/g/WBm2GAak3M\nSample-------- 15 sec, 9 MB\nEncoder------- HighCode","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d61ded2e509464a5f2896dcff96c56fd57c4f76","amp;dn":"Identity+2003+BDRip+1080p+x264+DTS+multisub-HighCode","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d61ded2e509464a5f2896dcff96c56fd57c4f76","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,97,222,210,229,9,70,74,95,40,150,220,255,150,197,111,213,124,79,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
