The papers feature original research in the areas of design and analysis of algorithms, computational geometry, graph drawing and graph algorithms. The papers are organized in topical sections on computational geometry, graph algorithms, complexity, graph drawing, approximation algorithms, and randomized algorithms.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b1fda49f6f5a58a2a74378fc03b0987b2d48455","amp;dn":"WALCOM%3A+Algorithms+and+Computation","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b1fda49f6f5a58a2a74378fc03b0987b2d48455","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,31,218,73,246,245,165,138,42,116,55,143,192,59,9,135,178,212,132,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
