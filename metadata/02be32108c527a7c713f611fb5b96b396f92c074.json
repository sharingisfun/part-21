The Lass of Aughrim; Ae Fond Kiss\n\nEwan McLennanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s second album brings together songs which champion the downtrodden, along with those expressing nostalgia for his homeland, punctuated with some dazzling instrumentals. The tracks are an almost even mix of traditional songs, covers and self-penned material.\n\nHe has an impressive collection of guest musicians in Karine Polwart (harmony vocal), John McCusker (fiddle), Martin Simpson (slide guitar), and Laurence Blackadder (double bass). Ewan doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t put all of these together to form a folk supergroup, but uses their talents sparingly to enhance his own performances.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02be32108c527a7c713f611fb5b96b396f92c074","amp;dn":"Ewan+McLennan+-+The+Last+Bird+To+Sing+%5B2012%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02be32108c527a7c713f611fb5b96b396f92c074","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,190,50,16,140,82,122,124,113,63,97,31,181,185,107,57,111,146,192,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
