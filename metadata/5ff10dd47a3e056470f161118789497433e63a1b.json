There the women of djerba make rugs &amp; carpets most of the year &amp; then their husbands come for one month to collect them &amp; head back to their bazaar shops in tunisia the capital, hence the name, season of men. Moufida does repeat here the haunting past with secrets like she did in silences of the palace. I couldn't sympathies with hend sabri's Emna,her character was a bit off putting unlike her sister meriem, who ghalya ben ali played the part quite well, perhaps it was the role but the one who really did shine &amp; is a promising talent is the young meriem, Azza baaziz, who was able to convey her emotions &amp; suffering better than anyone else in the film in my opinion. Moufida tlatli seems to have found another young promising talent in her just like she did with Hend sabri in the silences of the palace ten years ago. This film will be enjoyed by those who liked silences even if not in the same level of grandeur, this one is about breaking tradition, confronting your past &amp; finding yourself.\n\n\nThis beautifully lucid, compassionate film from Tunisian writer-director Moufida Tlatli is conducted at a walking, talking pace, allowing its audience unhurried access to a powerful and deeply engaging family drama. It's the story of a woman and her two daughters, and the female community that both nurtures and imprisons them on the Tunisian island of Djerba. Rabia Ben Abdallah is superb as Aicha, a woman who is married to a businessman away in Tunis and must live in a kind of purdah with all his sisters-in-law on the island. He and the other menfolk come to live with them for just one month a year - the &quot;season of men&quot;. With a wonderfully fluent gift for storytelling, Tlatli interleaves the past and present as naturally as the verses of a song, with a narrative mastery that she makes look easy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ff10dd47a3e056470f161118789497433e63a1b","amp;dn":"La+saison+des+hommes+%28Moufida+Tlatli%2C2000%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ff10dd47a3e056470f161118789497433e63a1b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,241,13,212,122,62,5,100,112,241,97,17,135,137,73,116,51,230,58,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
