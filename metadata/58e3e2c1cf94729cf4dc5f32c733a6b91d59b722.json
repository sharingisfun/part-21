A dark, psychological domestic drama, the screenplay by Peckinpah and David Zelag Goodman is based on the novel The Siege of Trencher's Farm by Gordon Williams. Controversial to this day, the film is noted for its violent concluding sequences and a complicated rape scene that critics point to as an example of Peckinpah's (and Hollywood's) debasing of women. Released theatrically the same year as A Clockwork Orange, The French Connection and Dirty Harry, the film sparked heated controversy over the perceived escalation of violence in cinema. It is considered one of Peckinpah's greatest films.\n\n---=Rip Info=------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\tVideo: 1.00 GB (92.51%)\n\tAudio: 72.9 MB (6.53%)\n\tAVI Overhead: 10.6 MB (0.95%)\n\t\n\t---=Audio=-------------------------------------\n\t0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\n\t48000Hz  87 kb/s tot , Joint Stereo  \n\tInterleave: 83 ms, preload 504\n\t\n\t---=Video=-------------------------------------\n\t704 x 400 @ 23.976 fps, XviD\n\t1:57:52, 169,552 frames\n\tQf 0.181/1225 kbps\n\n\t---=Size=--------------------------------------\n\t1,171,011,584 bytes (169,552 frames)\n\n\t---=Subtitles=---------------------------------\n\tSubtitles in IDX/RAR format for English, Malay, Thai, Chinese and Indonesian\n\t\t\n\t---=Credits=-----------------------------------\n\tThanks to Tansir and friends at DVD World\n\tRip and subtitles by -=:ZEiNAB:=-\n\t\n*********************************** FREAKYFLICKS ************************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
