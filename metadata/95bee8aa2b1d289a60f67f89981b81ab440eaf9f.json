After examining Lebanon's pre-war consociational democracy as well as the factors behind its collapse in 1975, Tamirace Fakhoury MÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¼hlbacher analyzes the post-war order (1990-2006) by shedding light on both interrelated phenomena: communal power-sharing in a turbulent environment and Lebanon's &quot;hybrid democratization&quot; between Syrian tutelage and the impulses for more liberalization against the backdrop of exogenous and endogenous factors. The author analyzes in detail Lebanon's uncertain 2005 system transition, the so-called 'Beirut Spring', and its aftermath. In a critical perspective, she highlights fundamental communal and political dynamics that result from the collision of internal and external conflict lines on Lebanese ground, and how the former have impeded balanced power-sharing and democratization in the small Arab Republic.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:95bee8aa2b1d289a60f67f89981b81ab440eaf9f","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2009%5D+Democracy+and+Power-Sharing+in+Stormy+Weather","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"95bee8aa2b1d289a60f67f89981b81ab440eaf9f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,190,232,170,43,29,40,154,96,246,127,137,152,27,129,171,68,14,175,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
