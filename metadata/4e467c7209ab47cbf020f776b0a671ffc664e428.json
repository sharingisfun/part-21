As in previous game you have to build houses, control resources to build combat vehicles and eliminate any foe, that shows in your sight. Turn-based elements allows you to show all your experience in military tactics.\n\nThis game didn't fare as well as the first one. I was a beta tester for this game back in the days when game companies gave out free copies to their testers. We all knew it wouldn't do as good as the 1st game mainly because the developers wanted to fare too far away from the tried &amp; true original concept. Most critics panned it though. I didn't think it was THAT bad and enjoy playing it once in a while almost as much as the first game.\n\nThis is an Alcohol Image.. no protection and no CDDA.\n\nI don't remember if the prequel gave you a choice.. but you can play this RTS OR turn-based style.\n\n\n\nExtract Archive With Winrar Or 7zip etc.........\n\nThen Mount Image Or Burn To CD\n\nInstall The Game And Play\n\n\nENJOY AND PLEASE SEED\n\n\nIF YOU HAVE PROBLEMS INSTALLING FROM AUTORUN MENU (I DID)\nTHEN BROWSE CD AND OPEN SETUP.exe \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e467c7209ab47cbf020f776b0a671ffc664e428","amp;dn":"M.A.X.2.Mechanized.Assault.%26.Exploration.PC.Game%28djDEVASTATE%C3%A2%E2%80%9E%C2%A2%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e467c7209ab47cbf020f776b0a671ffc664e428","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,70,124,114,9,171,71,203,240,32,247,118,176,166,113,255,198,100,228,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
