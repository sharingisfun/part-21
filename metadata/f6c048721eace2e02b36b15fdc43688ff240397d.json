Stars Arnold Schwarzenegger (Arnie's first feature role), Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn.\n\nWon't get into overwrought descriptions. You know the movie. Suffice it to say that this is very good vision, with the added advantage of a remastered soundtrack as per my usual standard. That is to say: fully audible dialogue while taking nothing from the music or SFX.\n\nVideo: BDrip x264 1918x1038 @ 2030kbps\nAudio: AC3 Stereo 2.0 Remastered (vocal compression, levelling, amplification to -1dB) @ 448kbps\nContainer: MP4\n\nThanks to all who seed!
