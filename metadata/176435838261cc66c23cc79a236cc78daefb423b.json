Frank Sinatra&amp;#039;s concept album about a bitter divorce is a pop album where words like beautiful, genious and magnificant aren&amp;#039;t big enough. This is the greatest voice ever with drums, guitar, electric bass, piano and strings, recorded in July 1969.\n\nHear the album, enjoy the lyrics. Music will never be the same again, I promise.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:176435838261cc66c23cc79a236cc78daefb423b","amp;dn":"Frank+Sinatra+-+Watertown+%281969+album%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"176435838261cc66c23cc79a236cc78daefb423b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,100,53,131,130,97,204,102,194,60,199,154,35,108,199,141,174,251,66,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
