The Coral Reef Center, however, is not what she needs to fix her career or tame her demons. Run by megalomaniac Shirley Cantwise, CRC is hiding psychotic staff members, dead bodies and extreme methods of behavioral control.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¦And A Dangerous Game of Cat and Mouse\n\nMindyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s one hope for escape is the appearance of Earl Grayson, the man she left two years earlier to keep him from learning the dark secrets of her past. Earl rushes to CRC when he learns she is there, offering support and still hoping for something more. He is the one person who can unlock MindyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s imprisoned heart, if she could only give him the key. Their reconciliation, however, is something Shirley Cantwise is determined to prevent. Obsessed with the handsome movie star, Shirley sees EarlÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s arrival at CRC as a sign sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s meant to have him. She will do whatever it takes to have Earl, and sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not about to let anything stand in her way. Especially not Mindy LePage.\n\nCreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform | English | July 20, 2014 | ISBN: 1500317950 | 368 pages | azw, epub, lrf, mobi | 4,9 mb\n\nMore About the Author\n\nBiography\nClara Grace Walker is a novelist of Mainstream Romantic Suspense, who finds this whole business of writing her bio rather vexing. What she really likes to do is hang out poolside on a lounge chair making things up. Or, as she calls it, spending time at her &quot;summer office.&quot; Recognizing that a bio is probably expected, however, she is willing to divulge the following information.\n\nShe was born in Texas and raised in Michigan, where she still lives, with her wonderful family and two very spoiled cats. She writes to stay sane, and because she has no idea how to not write. Having her debut novel, Gratification, hit Amazon's best-seller list was a great thrill and dream come true. She quickly followed that book up with two more, Gossip and Redemption. Together, these three books make up the Desire Never Dies trilogy.\n\nShe enjoys mixing together sex, romance, scheming and murder, and tells her tales in soap-opera-like fashion. Clara loves taking her readers on a ride filled with sensuality, intrigue and strong characters, only some of whom possess a moral compass. Buckle up. The ride's a bit bumpy!\n\nCurrently, Clara is working on a new 4-book series, Sex and Secrets. She hopes to bring many happy days of reading to her fans in the future.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d714734cac9dfbb797641508df9fb5dbd70bae5","amp;dn":"%5BClara_Grace_Walker%5DRedemption%28Desire+Never+Dies%29%28azw%2C+epub%2C+lrf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d714734cac9dfbb797641508df9fb5dbd70bae5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,113,71,52,202,201,223,187,121,118,65,80,141,249,251,93,189,112,186,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
