Sworn by his father to a blood oath against the Romans, Hannibal of Carthage does the unthinkable... he marches 40 war elephants and a massive army over the Alps to gain an element of surprise. In three key battles--Hannibal uses terrain, intimidation and his iron will to annihilate the Roman Legions, killing every Roman soldier that he possibly can.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:04d4be62422d9e577c419406a361f24f16d9b20a","amp;dn":"Battles+BC+-+S01E01+-+Hannibal+-+The+Annihilator","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"04d4be62422d9e577c419406a361f24f16d9b20a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,212,190,98,66,45,158,87,124,65,148,6,163,97,242,79,22,217,178,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
