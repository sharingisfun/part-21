While retaining the speed and aggression of earlier efforts, many fans maintain that virtually all of the songs on New Day Rising exhibit a strong pop sensibility. Guitarist and lead singer Bob Mould's trademark miasma of fuzz distortion is still present, but with much of the harsh rawness of previous efforts abandoned in favor of a more melodic sound.\n\nGenre:\tPunk\nLength:\t40:49\nLabel:\tSST\nFormat:\tFree Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nSource: CD\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThere is no delight in owning anything unshared.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Seneca, Roman philosopher","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:03e1146b15833e5d164093d70329b83b43a4b856","amp;dn":"H%C3%83%C2%BCsker+D%C3%83%C2%BC+-+New+Day+Rising+-+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"03e1146b15833e5d164093d70329b83b43a4b856","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,225,20,107,21,131,62,93,22,64,147,215,3,41,184,59,67,164,184,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
