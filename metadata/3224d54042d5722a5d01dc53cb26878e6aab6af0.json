The songs tend toward the winding and ponderous side, and the vocals -- especially those by female singer Aletta -- can cross into the histrionic in the more strident passages. Perhaps a little more influenced by the male-female vocal tradeoffs typical of some late-'60s American psychedelic bands than most such British efforts, it also boasts plenty of hard rock guitar and a good helping of lyrics reflective of a fantasy world, ÃƒÂ  la &quot;Princess and the Peasant Boy&quot; and the title track. As the song that brings in the strongest British acoustic folk feel, &quot;Dream&quot; is one of the more palatable tracks, but groups such as Renaissance were able to craft more accessible and memorable material using some of the same elements\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3224d54042d5722a5d01dc53cb26878e6aab6af0","amp;dn":"Saturnalia+-+Magical+Love+%281969%2F2003%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3224d54042d5722a5d01dc53cb26878e6aab6af0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,36,213,64,66,213,114,42,93,1,220,83,203,38,135,142,106,171,106,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
