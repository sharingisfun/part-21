It features beat production from long-time music affiliates BUCK 65, ALIAS, CECIL OTTER, REANIMATOR, and more. \n\n&quot;VONNEGUT BUSY&quot;, the lead single, acts as a stylistic sample dish for what one can expect from the new album, transitioning seamlessly from socio-economic issues to personal politics, all while being punctuated by the project's overall mission statement: &quot;When it seems like you're going through hell...keep going.&quot; The reference to Kurt Vonnegut in the title is accompanied by a quote from the satirical writer in one of the song's 3 sub-choruses: &quot;Of all the words of mice and men, the saddest are, 'it might have been.'&quot; \n\nreleased 03 June 2014 \n\n01 PRESSURE COOKER (music by Cecil Otter) \n02 GRACE (music by ALXNDRBRWN) \n03 ID THIEVES (music by James Hancock &amp; Poindexter) \n04 CHEAT CODE (music by Reanimator) \n05 DEAD MANÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S FLOAT (music by Cecil Otter) \n06 OVER UNDER (music by Le Parasite) \n07 MAKE EM PURR (music by Buck 65) \n08 VONNEGUT BUSY (music by Prolyphic, horn by Joshua Trinidad) \n09 THANK YOU (music by Anders Parker) \n10 THE SET UP (music by Alias) \n11 THE PLACE SHE FEARED MOST (music by Reanimator) \n12 ONCE UPON A BLUE MOON (music by Dub Sonata) \n13 SAY UNCLE (music by John Ash) \n14 MAINT REQD (music by Kurtis SP)\n\nLazy soundcloud rip made with fraps, go buy it on his site if you want a more convenient format.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:92a962bbdc1297466700116bb6a92dc437f220ed","amp;dn":"Sage+Francis+-+Copper+Gone+%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"92a962bbdc1297466700116bb6a92dc437f220ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,169,98,187,220,18,151,70,103,0,17,107,182,169,45,196,55,242,32,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
