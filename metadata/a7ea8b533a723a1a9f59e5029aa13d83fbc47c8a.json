I would have guessed that most people\nwould have it as it was a TV broadcast at some point in Holland. The VHS to MPEG is an amature\ntransfer at best, but still nice if you have not seen this one. There are moments when frames &quot;go out&quot;,\nor very short sound changes, but overall good. Equal Rights-Downpresser Man are my favorite tracks.\nAnd since Mama Africa was an album I listened to growing up, it was nice to see Don Kinsey on this, as\nhis guitar is vastly what sticks in my brain from songs like Not Gonna Give It Up. Note, no editing was\nmade to this besides transferring, nor splitting into smaller video files. No worries from me if someone\nwant's to improve this...just keep the text/source.\n\n1.
