The song is now well over 20 years old, yet the record company still has only ever digitally released the LP versionÃ¢â‚¬â€which wasn't even the one that was a hit. They no longer promote it and never offered it in a lossless format. Their incompetence and disinterest are your gain: Here's a lossless rip of a rare promotional CD maxi-single containing all the club &amp; radio mixes of &quot;This House&quot;.\n\nVery limited seeding ability here; please help if you can.\n\nInfo links:\nWikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_House_(Tracie_Spencer_song)\nDiscogs: http://www.discogs.com/Tracie-Spencer-This-House/release/505846","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7d1d1b7ff2cc9dcb08294f4bd0ef07fbac41518","amp;dn":"%5B1990%5D+Tracie+Spencer+-+This+House+%5Bpromo+CD5%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7d1d1b7ff2cc9dcb08294f4bd0ef07fbac41518","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,209,209,183,255,44,201,220,176,130,148,244,189,14,240,127,186,196,21,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
