Mastered at The Exchange, London.\n\nBrought to you by TQMP\nThe Quality Music Project\n\n&quot;Irakere is Cuba's, and in my opinion, the world's greatest and most influential Afro-Cuban Jazz band ever. There is no better setting to hear this incredible group than a live setting. This CD was recorded live in 1991 at London's famed Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club. Although many obviously feel that the original version of Irakere, which included Arturo Sandoval and Paquito D'Rivera along with Chucho Valdes, is the best incarnation of the group, there is no denying the incredible power and virtuoso musicianship of this incarnation of the group from the late 80's-early 90's which included Orlando &quot;Maraca&quot; Valle on flute, Miguel &quot;Anga&quot; Diaz on congas and percussion, Cesar Lopez on sax, and Juan Munguia on trumpet. The bottom line is that every version of this group has been phenomenal, right down to the current, younger version that is still very much alive and well in Cuba! This great disc captures the incredible jazz sound of Irakere live, from Chucho's brilliant piano work, to the blazing horns and powerful percussion that has defined Irakere since it's inception in 1973, and has influenced countless latin jazz and dance groups not only in Cuba, but throughout the world. Any disc from Irakere is a winner, but this happens to be one of my favorites.&quot;\n-- user review @ amazon.com\n\nTracks\n1- Neurosis\n2- Cuando Canta El Corazon\n3- Mirando Arriba\n4- Flute Notes\n5- Mr. Bruce\n6- Claudia\n\nArtwork (300dpi scan), EAC log and CUE sheet included.\n\nTools used -\nExact Audio Copy 0.99 prebeta 3\nFLAC frontend 1.7.1\nFLAC encoder/decoder 1.2.1\nreference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\n\nFormat: FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://flac.sourceforge.net/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://flac.sourceforge.net/index.html&lt;/a&gt; \n\nEnjoy, seed and inhale!\n\nLegalise it!\n\nPastafari.Cubensis &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&lt;/a&gt;\nProud Member of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://venganza.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://venganza.org&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f27e7f423476c34956c3b089c080df744d8364f1","amp;dn":"Irakere+-+Live+At+Ronnie+Scott%5C%27s+%5BFLAC%5D+TQMP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f27e7f423476c34956c3b089c080df744d8364f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,126,127,66,52,118,195,73,86,195,176,137,192,128,223,116,77,131,100,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
