DostoevskyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCrime and PunishmentÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ supplies this work with its ideological theme and the historical setting, but its plot. The novelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s events and familiar characters are simply not mentioned. If anything, they are represented in an ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œinverse perspective,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ where proximity is united with remoteness, beginning with end, the present with the absent.\n\nThe historical features of a way of life ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ whether they be manifested through environment or apparel ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ are at times presented concretely, at times merely suggested. A ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œphysiological sketchÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ of the City, a literary genre of DostoevskyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s time, is turned into a grotesque metaphor that reveals the CityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s tragic essence and is extended to signify the dismal reality of our present day. Life has been reduced to its barest physical functions. The City ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ once ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œimbued with the spiritual darkness of all its convocating souls,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ as seen by Pasternak in his ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œchildish dreamsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ is represented in SokurovÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s film as the womb of a beast in its final agony.\n\nAll action, all motivation here is savage and brutal; there is little place for nature and the living. For nature is the very spirit of life, and a spirit cannot inhabit lifeless flesh. In the opening images which serve as the prologue of the film, the camera glides almost imperceptibly through the City, along its skeleton: the grey, cold honeycomb facade of the ubiquitous tenement building, destined to the oppressed and destitute, whose windows, mere eyeless sockets, are reflected below in the dull waters of a torpid canal. Over this landscape, with its layers of smoke and steam, soar a few white seagulls. And along the dreary walls lining the skyless streets, a solitary young man wanders amid jostling human hordes.\n\nHe is evidently seeking something ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ his own lost soul or perhaps the souls of those whose lives he has destroyed in the past. Here he is kicked, knocked to the ground, dragged to his feet, pulled along by his hairÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ is forced to write up official documents and is enveloped by sinister mobs. Yet he eventually flees. Just as he flees from the very soul of life which appears before him one day in the guise of an ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œinnocent girl.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ He plagues this young soul with unanswerable questions when she tries to show him the way to repentance. Instead of repentance, prison followsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ with all its horrors and anguish. Ultimately the young man takes refuge beneath the stony form of a chimeric beast, a token of the soulless City. He is seen pressed against its barren womb, trying to offer it some filial tenderness.\n\nTwentieth century art has offered disturbing and hopeless views of reality. Chekhov, one of the prophets of this century, spoke of the deterioration of life and its values: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe city is dead and inhabited by the deadÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a quotation that could well be the epigraph of this film. Certainly it is not coincidental that Chekhov was the protagonist of SokurovÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s preceding film. The cultural traditions of two centuries merge into the work of this contemporary author, a Russian filmmaker.\n\nThese are the traditions of Pushkin, Gogol, Dostoyevsky and Eisenstein. But this filmmaker does not confine himself to temporal or national limits: the film score embraces motifs of world art; isolated images employing spatial deformations hark back to German expressionist cinema; poignant closeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ups of the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œchildÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“womanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ are reminiscent of GriffithÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s victim-heroines. In the finale we hear a womanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s voice singing MahlerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œKindertotenliederÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ which serves as a requiem for the life and lives that have been wasted and for the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œbroken blossomsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ of all times and all nations.\n\n---------not my rip-----\n\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 771,918,554 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 1:16:55\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: DivX 5.x/6.x\nFrame Size ......................................: 640x480 (AR: 1.333)\nFPS .................................................: 25.000\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1200 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.156 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 128 kb/s [2 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1 \n\n***************\n\n    Freakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
