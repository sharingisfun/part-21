After graduation, Jess packs up everything she owns and moves to Beijing on a whim, while Rachel heads to New York to work for an art gallery and to figure out her love life. Each spends the next few years tumbling through adulthood and reinventing themselves in various countries, including France, China, and Australia. Through their messages from around the world, they swap tales of teaching classes of military men, running a magazine, and flirting in foreign languages, along with the hard stuff: from harrowing accidents to breakups and breakdowns.\n\nReminiscent of Sloan CrosleyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s essays and Lena DunhamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Girls, Graduates in Wonderland is an intimate, no-holds-barred portrait of two young women as they embark upon adulthood. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7cdfd14e6249781f2ba5fdddd622184ffcd46f99","amp;dn":"Graduates+in+Wonderland-+The+International+Misadventures+of+Two+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7cdfd14e6249781f2ba5fdddd622184ffcd46f99","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,223,209,78,98,73,120,31,43,165,253,221,214,34,24,79,252,212,111,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
