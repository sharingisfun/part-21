His story is quite unusual: although he had no formal education inmathematics, he taught himself, and managed to produce many important new results. With the support of the English number theorist G. H. Hardy, Ramanujan received a scholarship to go to England and study mathematics. He died very young, at the age of 32, leaving behind three notebooks containing almost 3000 theorems, virtually all without proof. G. H. Hardy and others strongly urged that notebooks be edited and published, and the result is this series of books. This volume dealswith Chapters 1-9 of Book II; each theorem is either proved, or a reference to a proof is given.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8de7d56d92b9758a84cc6e85d8ef0795e68cac85","amp;dn":"Ramanujan%27s+Notebooks%3A+Part+I","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8de7d56d92b9758a84cc6e85d8ef0795e68cac85","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,231,213,109,146,185,117,138,132,204,110,133,216,239,7,149,230,140,172,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
