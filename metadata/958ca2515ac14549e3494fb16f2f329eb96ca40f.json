For good reasons as it is the main airport for the Turkish Mediterranean holiday destinations and in high season the airport has to cope with huge amounts of passengers eager to get to the hotels or eager to get home.\n\nDetails:\n\nWith 16 of the 18 million passengers being foreigners  it is clear this is not a standard airport. Just go there in August and you see an airport running at maximum capacity.\n\nThe rendering of this airport in FSX is done by our internal Aerosoft modelers, and include some rather special animations (something we feel is not used enough). From the building sites to the big Turkish flags near the roads. In high summer you even see the dust clouds that wreak havoc on the delicate engines.\n\nAESLite is of course used to make the airport more alive with vehicles and the airport is fully covered by the full AES as long as you got the latest version. Note that the more advanced features used will not work in the limited DX10 mode of FSX.\n\nFeatures FS2004:\n\n    * Complete coverage of the airport and immediate vicinity\n    * High resolution day- and night textures\n    * Photorealistic textures on buildings, vehicles, etc.\n    * AESLite used to make the airport come to life\n    * Covered by AES 2.08\n    * Advanced lighting  \n    * Compatible with all AI Traffic addons\n    * Very easy on framerates (but do read the manual)\n    * Simple installer, no DRM included","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:958ca2515ac14549e3494fb16f2f329eb96ca40f","amp;dn":"FS2004+-+Aerosoft+Antalya+X","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"958ca2515ac14549e3494fb16f2f329eb96ca40f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,140,162,81,90,193,69,73,227,73,79,177,111,47,50,158,185,108,164,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
