The two only recorded one song before being joined by Nero Lord on guitar. After that, Draugr swiched to playing bass while still doing lead vocals. \nAs of very early 2013 Lilin has been set on making Raw American Black Metal filled with misanthropy, rebellion, rage, and SCORN set to kick off a new wave in American black metal.\n\non facebook[/url]\n\nLilin on myspace[/url]\n\n[img]http://i16.photobucket.com/albums/b30/BAPHOM3T_666/3540264944_logo_zps5e9ad886.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i16.photobucket.com/albums/b30/BAPHOM3T_666/3540264944_photo_zps1329e02b.jpg[/img]\n\nCurrent lineup: \nMephisto - Bass\nAeolous - Guitars\nBaratrum - Vocals\nTroll - Drums, Vocals (backing) (2007-present), Guitars (2007-present)\nNero Lord - Guitar, Vocals (backing) (2007-present) ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:320202eadfd5add4ceffbc764a44907b109a2e94","amp;dn":"Lilin+-+Aeon+of+Scorn+%282013%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"320202eadfd5add4ceffbc764a44907b109a2e94","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,2,2,234,223,213,173,212,206,255,188,118,74,68,144,123,16,154,46,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
