This monograph examines the militaries of Nigeria, Argentina, Egypt and India in times of crisis to challenge these assumptions. \n\nThe book shows that despite having broad similarities, each of these states had unique characteristics that impacted their military effectiveness in different ways. These key variables included the military institutionsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ maturity and skill sets, the availability and management of human and material resources, and the quality of both civil and military leadership.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c2033c760b5af99cef1d9a9bd1d7aae10a957ed","amp;dn":"The+Military+Effectiveness+of+Post-Colonial+States","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c2033c760b5af99cef1d9a9bd1d7aae10a957ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,32,51,199,96,181,175,153,206,241,217,169,189,29,122,174,16,169,87,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
