Author Stig Nybo draws inspiration from successful behavior change campaigns to identify the drivers of changeÃ¢â‚¬â€context and beliefsÃ¢â‚¬â€and how they can be successfully employed to boost retirement savings rates. While the retirement savings industry increasingly embraces the contextual drivers of behavior, very little is being done to shape our beliefs to start saving smarter and sooner. Nybo suggests a retirement readiness campaign to inspire and enlist the support of individuals, employers, industry, government, and the media.\n* Explains how society can transition from treating 401(k) as a voluntary benefit to the basis upon which each individual who wants to or needs to can retire comfortably.\n* Details a national, coordinated retirement readiness campaign, along the lines of successful Public Service AdvertisementsÃ¢â‚¬â€like &quot;The Crying Indian&quot; and Rosie the RiveterÃ¢â‚¬â€that will help change behavior and re-shape the culture of our nation\n* Makes a call to action for such a campaign\n\nRetirement in America is endangered, but Transform Tomorrow shows a path back from the brink.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40800de3bbc7e60faa90fab7e6c5b1dddcd5c69c","amp;dn":"Transform+Tomorrow%3A++In+Pursuit+of+Retirement+Readiness","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40800de3bbc7e60faa90fab7e6c5b1dddcd5c69c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,128,13,227,187,199,230,15,170,144,250,183,230,197,177,221,220,213,198,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
