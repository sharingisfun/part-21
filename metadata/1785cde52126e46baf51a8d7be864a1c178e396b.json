It also includes some miscellanea that I wanted to add (I have no idea why). The entire Ã¢â‚¬Å“thingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in no way constitutes an album or whatever. I regard the project as open as Dwarf Fortress is. The trained ear will know that the songs are far from perfect, but I utilized the best of what my Google musical degree and free time provide. The writing? There are legions who write stories inspired by DF. This is just my drop in the bucket.\n\nMy music and all my content may be distributed freely and used wherever and for whatever you like, but remember what world(s) they were inspired by (and who made them, plz). Also, remember always to support Tarn and Zach in their development of Dwarf Fortress (http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/).\n\nSimon Swerwer","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1785cde52126e46baf51a8d7be864a1c178e396b","amp;dn":"Simon+Swerwer+Soundsense+Fun+Pack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1785cde52126e46baf51a8d7be864a1c178e396b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,133,205,229,33,38,228,107,175,81,168,215,190,134,74,28,23,142,57,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
