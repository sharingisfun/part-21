Civilian access to existing airports such as Boeing Field &amp; TacomaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Mchord Field was becoming limited due to construction of a growing number of B17 bombers.\nNorthwest Airlines &amp; American Airlines were the first to set up shop &amp; Western Airlines, Alaska Airlines &amp; Pan Am operated many flights through Sea-Tac. In October 1959, a Pan Am Boeing 707 took off for Honolulu becoming Sea-TacÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s first regular jet service.
