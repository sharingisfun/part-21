The members of Led By The Blind were spawned from half human and half extra-terrestrial DNA. An ancient extra-terrestrial family then brought them to Earth where they joined as one to spread the message that we are not alone. With all of them implanted with homing devices, each member easily found one another after years of honing their individual skills to be sure the message could be heard. They say donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t believe what you hear. If you see it, believe it. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re all led by the blind.\n\nDescription\nHeavy Alternative Metal\n\nBand Interests\nEh, you know... making music and such. But really. Our personal interests range greatly. Collectively we are very involved in art, be it visual, interpretive, or audio. Snowboarding, motocross, bmx, skateboarding and racing, are also activities and lifestyles that have influenced who we are, how we view the world and ultimately how we write music.\n\nGenre\t\nSpace Metal (It's new.)\n\nMembers\nRyan Sullivan - Vocals\n\nJake Brodka - Bass/Vocals\n\nJamie Ervay - Drums/Vocals\n\nMark Gibbs - Air guitar\n\nJeff Pennachio - Lead Guitar\n\nRecord Label\t\nSlacker ProductionsÃ¢â€žÂ¢\n\nGeneral Manager\t\nJamie Ervay\n\nInfluences\nTool, Parkway Drive, As I Lay Dying, Lamb Of God, August Burns Red, Veil Of Maya, As Blood Runs Black, Darkest Hour, Scary Kids Scaring Kids, A Day To Remember, Pantera, Sardonic Grin, Sublime, Goldfinger, Underoath, Devil Driver, Metallica, Nine Inch Nails, Stone Temple Pilots, A Perfect Circle, The Classic Crime, Incubus, Led Zeppelin\n\nCurrent Location\nSouthern Tier of Western NY\n\n\nWebsites\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.last.fm/music/Led+By+The+Blind&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.last.fm/music/Led+By+The+Blind&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nThis torrent is anonymous simply because my real username would give away who I am.\n\nOne last thing:\n\nSEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED\n\n\nSEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED\n\n\nSEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED\n\n\nSEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED\n\n\nSEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED\n\n\nSEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED\n\n\nSEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED\n\n\nSEED SEED SEED SEED SEED SEED\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b3f6feb6d2a0c815f13ef07b6e4c9eec8e04ed1","amp;dn":"Led+By+The+Blind+-+Controversy+2011+320+KBPS+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b3f6feb6d2a0c815f13ef07b6e4c9eec8e04ed1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,63,111,235,109,42,12,129,95,19,239,7,182,228,201,238,200,224,78,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
