Gordian Knot also included guitarists Ron Jarzombek and Glenn Snelwar. As well as playing atmospheric and heavy progressive music, the group also experimented on their eponymous debut with Eastern-influenced pieces. Malone soon began working on a sequel with a whole new roster of prog rock guests, including former Genesis guitarist Steve Hackett and former Yes drummer Bill Bruford.\n\nAll Music: http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:fjfexqujld0e\n\nSample: http://media.putfile.com/07---The-Brook-The-Ocean-13","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e32c24714155ea716dc98034c96fa7b320aa5262","amp;dn":"Gordian+Knot+-+Emergent.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e32c24714155ea716dc98034c96fa7b320aa5262","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,44,36,113,65,85,234,113,109,201,128,52,201,111,167,179,32,170,82,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
