Low resolution. It is perfectly watchable and enjoyable.\n\nThe original DVD image file was posted here: \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://fanedit.org/wpTF/?p=296&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://fanedit.org/wpTF/?p=296&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nthrough Rapidshare.\n\nIt was still available there as of 1-24-2008.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d9e58646bdea3bcb7de24dddb705191260cb97c","amp;dn":"Movie+from+Star+Trek%3A+Borg+Interactive+Movie","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d9e58646bdea3bcb7de24dddb705191260cb97c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,158,88,100,107,222,163,188,183,222,36,221,219,112,81,145,38,12,185,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
