Furthermore, the music isn't really music in a normal sense, but rather rudimentary themes presented at various lengths to create or support an immediate atmosphere. Still, labels like KPM often use well-known musicians and composers, and hence their records have in some cases become highly collectible. \n\nJohn Renbourn has made two albums for KPM, with &quot;The Guitar of ...&quot;, here given a broader release, probably coming as close as anything ever will to a library disc sounding like a commercial CD (his other KPM release is identical to one of his official discs, so don't worry too much about how to get hold of that one). Recorded in 1977 it represents the acoustic guitarist at his very best, with flute, electric guitar and female vocals also featured on various tracks - all wonderfully performed. This release is not quite on par with his outstanding album &quot;The Hermit&quot; from around that same time, but certain tracks come very close, and at other times it is just very interesting to hear the artist work within an unusual framework. (And if it's just some nice yet characteristic background music you're after, it works very well, too.) \n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b2191debdae2c970f3ecb1897875e25db679151","amp;dn":"John+Renbourn...The+Guitar+of+John+Renbourn%281977%29+CD%282008%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b2191debdae2c970f3ecb1897875e25db679151","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,33,145,222,189,174,44,151,15,62,203,24,151,135,94,37,219,103,145,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
