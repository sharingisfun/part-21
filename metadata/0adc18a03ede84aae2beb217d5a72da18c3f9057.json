Thrill sounds more mature on its debut, Vulture, than most artists on their first albums. There's a good reason for that: The members of 3 Lb. Thrill previously released several albums under the name Uncle Green. 3 Lb. Thrill, like Uncle Green, has a knack for performing taut poppy tunes with a Beatlesque edge. Highlights included &quot;Born Again,&quot; &quot;Bad Seed,&quot; &quot;Collide,&quot; and many others. A nice debut that sounds a lot like Uncle Green, which is good.
