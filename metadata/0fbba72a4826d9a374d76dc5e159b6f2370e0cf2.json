Sunnyland Slim's swinging New York rhythm section has no  trouble following his bedrock piano, and the estimable King Curtis peels off diamond-hard tenor sax solos in the great Texas tradition that also mesh seamlessly. Slim runs through his standards -- &quot;The Devil Is a Busy Man,&quot; &quot;Shake It,&quot; &quot;It's You Baby&quot; -- in gorgeous stereo, and two unissued bonus cuts (including another of his best-known tunes, &quot;Everytime I Get to Drinking&quot;) make the CD reissue of Slim's Shout even more appealing. ~ Bill Dahl\n\n\nRecorded in September, 1960.Englewood Cliffs, NJ (09/15/1960).\n\nPersonnel: Sunnyland Slim (vocals, piano); King Curtis (tenor saxophone); Robert Banks (organ); Belton Evans (drums).\n\n1.
