There is truth here for all ages and beliefs. If Darwin was wrong...........then the Schools have been intentionally lying to our Children. If the schools teach Darwinism which says there is NO CHRIST. Then they are of The Anti-Christ. Public Schools teaching books CHANGE EVERY YEAR. The Bible never changes. So where is truth??? In Evolution Theories??? If you believe in Evolution you are denying The Father, The Son and The Holy Spirit of the Praise They are entitled too for making everything you understand and can see and more than that, everything you don't understand and can't see. If you have never thanked the CREATOR for his Creation now is your chance to thank Him.\n\nDescription\nVideos by DR. CHARLES JACKSON:\n\n\nThe Privileged Planet:\nMany scientists and philosophers have claimed that Earth is an ordinary speck of dust adrift, without purpose or significance, in a vast cosmic sea. Yet current astronomical evidence seems to suggest just the opposite.\n\nWe now know that a rare and finely-tuned array of factors makes Earth suitable for complex life. We depend on our planetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s oxygen-rich atmosphere, its large moon, its planetary neighbors, and its precise location within the solar system and Milky Way galaxy. But there is more. The same factors that make a planet like Earth hospitable to life also provide the best conditions for scientific discovery.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d01662edf477f337c5a9a4fde3b32f1c61156d4d","amp;dn":"POtHS+-+Creation+-+39+-+The+Privileged+Planet+and+The+God+Within","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d01662edf477f337c5a9a4fde3b32f1c61156d4d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,22,98,237,244,119,243,55,197,169,164,253,227,179,47,28,97,21,109,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
