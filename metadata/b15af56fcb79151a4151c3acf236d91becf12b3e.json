The band's musical style incorporates classical, orchestral, symphonic, and progressive elements into hard rock and heavy metal. The orchestra is most famous for their Christmas-themed series of rock operas (Christmas Eve and Other Stories, The Christmas Attic, and The Lost Christmas Eve), for which they do an annual winter tour. Their other releases are based on historical themes (Beethoven's Last Night and Night Castle). Trans-Siberian Orchestra is also known for their extensive charity work and elaborate concerts, which are complete with a full orchestra, a massive light show, lasers, dozens of pyrotechnics, moving trusses, video screens, and other effects that are synchronized to the actual music.\n\nThe Trans-Siberian Orchestra is known for their incorporation of classical, orchestral, symphonic, and progressive elements into rock and heavy metal music. They are listed under many genres, but mostly symphonic rock, progressive rock, neo-classical metal, and classical music. Three of their albums ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Christmas Eve and Other Stories ( 1996 ), The Christmas Attic ( 1998 ), The Lost Christmas Eve ( 2004 ) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ are based around Christmas themes. These rock operas, collectively known as the &quot;Christmas trilogy,&quot; remain their best-selling and most famous works.\n\nBoth in the recording studio and live, Trans-Siberian Orchestra uses a full orchestra, choirs, and a constantly growing and changing group of singers and musicians. It was founded and is produced and led by head composer and lyricist Paul O'Neill, alongside composer and vocalist Jon Oliva and guitarist and music director Al Pitrelli (both members of the progressive metal band Savatage), with co-producer, composer, and keyboardist Robert Kinkel.\n\nNight Castle is the fifth album released by the Trans-Siberian Orchestra. It was released on October 27, 2009. It is only the second studio album released by TSO that does not involve a Christmas theme, the other being Beethoven's Last Night. It includes a version of &quot;O Fortuna&quot; from Carmina Burana by Carl Orff, which was previewed live by the band during their 2004-2008 tours. It also contains four rewritten versions of previous Savatage songs as well as &quot;Nutrocker&quot;, a song by famed Runaways producer Kim Fowley with guest bassist Greg Lake from Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer.\n\n\nTrackList\n\nCD 1\n\n01 - Night Enchanted\n02 - Childhood Dreams\n03 - Sparks\n04 - The Mountain\n05 - Night Castle\n06 - The Safest Way Into Tomorrow\n07 - Mozart and Memories\n08 - Another Way You Can Die\n09 - Toccata - Carpimus Noctem\n10 - The Lion's Roar\n11 - Dreams We Conceive\n12 - Mother and Son\n13 - There Was a Life\n\nCD 2\n\n01 - Moonlight And Madness\n02 - Time Floats On\n03 - Epiphany\n04 - Bach Lullaby\n05 - Father, Son &amp; Holy Ghost\n06 - Remnants of a Lullaby\n07 - The Safest Way Into Tomorrow (Reprise)\n08 - Embers\n09 - Child of the Night\n10 - Believe\n11 - Nutrocker\n12 - Carmina Burana\n13 - Tracers\n\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\nFormato                          : MPEG Audio\nVersione del formato             : Version 1\nProfilo del formato              : Layer 3\nModalitÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â                          : Costante\nBitRate                          : 320 Kbps\nCanali                           : 2 canali\nSamplingRate                     : 44,1 KHz\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\nJoin www.nautilus-bt.org","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b15af56fcb79151a4151c3acf236d91becf12b3e","amp;dn":"Trans-Siberian+Orchestra+-+Night+Castle+%5BMP3+320kbps%5D%5BNautilus-B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b15af56fcb79151a4151c3acf236d91becf12b3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,90,245,111,203,121,21,26,65,81,195,172,242,54,217,27,236,241,43,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
