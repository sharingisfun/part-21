K. Dezerterzy [aka H. M. Deserters] | 1985 | Poland\n\nGenre:    Comedy | Adventure | War\nRuntime:  2:31:58\nSource:   DVD\nEncoding: XviD\nVideo:    720x512/544, 23.97 fps, 4:3 aspect ratio\nAudio:    MPEG Stereo, 48kHz, 128kbps VBR\nLanguage: Polish (audio), English (subtitles)\nIMDB:    &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092713/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092713/&lt;/a&gt;\nRating:   7.3/10 (295 votes)\n\nStarring: Wiktor Zborowski, Marek Kondrat, Zoltan Bezerdy and Wojciech Pokora\nDirected by: Janusz Majewski\n\nNotes:\n\n - Even though encoded from DVD, it seems that the DVD was actually a transfer from videotape, not film. Thus:\n\t\t- The quality is somewhat less than standard DVD. It's still watchable and enjoyable of course.\n\t\t- The audio is also much louder in the second part (even though I normalized both.)\n\t\t- The black framing rectangle in the second part is quite a few degrees off-level.\n   So, not my fault. :^)\n\n - The IMDB entry lists the year of release as 1986, but it was actually 1985.\n\n - The C.K. (Polish) and H.M. (English) in the title (roughly) translates to the abbreviation for &quot;Imperial and Royal&quot; [Army] as the Austro-Hungarian empire at the time consisted of Hungary which had a king and Austria which had an emperor (and the leader of the empire was both.) This isn't explained on the IMDB entry anywhere I could find.\n\n - To use the subtitles, simply extract the .SUB file from the .RAR archive into the same folder. A free app. that will extract .RAR archives is 7-Zip from http://www.7-zip.org/\n \n - I seed using &quot;Initial Seeding&quot; which means that the torrent may show zero seeds; disregard this as I will seed for up to several days until there are enough other seeds.\n \n - This is a long movie; it will take nearly two days to complete the initial seeding so please BE PATIENT.\n\n - Please make sure to seed as my upstream is rather slow (256kbps.) At 1.2GB if leechers let the torrent die I won't be able to fix it. Please do your part so free media will always be available. If everyone seeded to at least 101%, no torrent would ever die.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac0df87ed3a7b7d6e53c38c07ba28d30e6f87a02","amp;dn":"C.+K.+Dezerterzy+%5Baka+H.+M.+Deserters%5D+%281985%29.DVDRip.XviD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac0df87ed3a7b7d6e53c38c07ba28d30e6f87a02","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,13,248,126,211,167,183,214,229,60,56,192,123,162,141,48,230,248,122,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
