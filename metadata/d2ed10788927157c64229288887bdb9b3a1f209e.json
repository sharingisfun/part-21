By identifying risk factors during processing as well as determining appropriate &quot;safe&quot; thresholds of ingredients, the food industry must take increasingly proactive steps to avoid direct or cross-contamination as well as ensuring that their products are appropriately labeled and identified for those at risk.\n\nThis book covers a range of critical topics in this area, including the epidemiology of food allergy, assessing allergen thresholds and risk, specifics of gluten management and celiac disease, and much more. The practical advice on factory risk management, catering industry practices, allergen detection and measurement and regulatory controls is key for food industry professionals as well as regulators in government and other public bodies.\n\n*Science-based insights into the potential risks of food allergens *Focused section on determining thresholds *Practical guidance on food allergen risk management, including case studies","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d2ed10788927157c64229288887bdb9b3a1f209e","amp;dn":"Risk+Management+for+Food+Allergy+-+PDF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d2ed10788927157c64229288887bdb9b3a1f209e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,237,16,120,137,39,21,124,100,34,146,136,136,123,219,155,58,31,32,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
