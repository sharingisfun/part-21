They were also nominated for a Grammy Award in 1987. After their third album Simple Mission and a brief Canadian tour in early 1993, the band went on a lengthy hiatus. Lead singer Alan Frew released two solo albums before the band reformed and began touring again around 2003.\n\nOn 6 November 2004 Glass Tiger hosted a Saturday night retro show on CIQB-FM in Barrie, Ontario under the direction of station program director Darren Stevens.\n\nIn 2005 the band released a new DVD collection No Turning Back. On June 23, 2005, they appeared on the NBC television show Hit Me Baby One More Time, performing their classic hit &quot;Don&amp;#039;t Forget Me (When I&amp;#039;m Gone)&quot; and covering &quot;Everything You Want&quot; (originally recorded by Vertical Horizon). Although they lost the audience voting to Thelma Houston, Glass Tiger were judged the winners by online voters.\n\nIn a mid-2006 interview on Entertainment Tonight Canada, Glass Tiger hinted they were back in the studio to record new material. Meanwhile, the band continues to tour throughout Canada. A new DVD titled &quot;Glass Tiger Live in Concert&quot; featuring the band in concert from the 1980s was also released in 2006.\n\nAir Time: The Best of Glass Tiger is Canadian band Glass Tiger&amp;#039;s first Greatest Hits album.\n\n\n\n\n\nTracks:\n\n\n&quot;Don&amp;#039;t Forget Me (When I&amp;#039;m Gone)&quot; \n&quot;Thin Red Line&quot; \n&quot;Someday&quot; \n&quot;I Will Be There&quot; \n&quot;You&amp;#039;re What I Look For&quot; \n&quot;After the Dance&quot; \n&quot;Diamond Sun&quot; \n&quot;I&amp;#039;m Still Searching&quot; \n&quot;My Song&quot; \n&quot;(Watching) Worlds Crumble&quot; \n&quot;Animal Heart&quot; \n&quot;Blinded&quot; \n&quot;Rhythm Of Your Love&quot; \n&quot;Rescued (By the Arms of Love)&quot; \n&quot;Simple Mission&quot; \n&quot;My Town&quot; \n&quot;Touch of Your Hand [Demo Version]&quot; \n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e7534e41ac526b811513365de64a761e9c3e8765","amp;dn":"Glass+Tiger+-+Air+Time+%28Greatest+Hits%29+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e7534e41ac526b811513365de64a761e9c3e8765","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,83,78,65,172,82,107,129,21,19,54,93,230,74,118,30,156,62,135,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
