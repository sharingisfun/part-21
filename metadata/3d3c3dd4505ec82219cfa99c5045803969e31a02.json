Summoned to settle the score between two warring factions, Fett quickly shows his employers the importance of always choosing the right tool for the job, and the folly of underestimating just how much damage and chaos a single Mandalorian can inflict. Once unleashed, Fett's drive to finish the job is unshakable, and both groups quickly realize theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re dealing with a bigger and much deadlier mutual problemÃ¢â‚¬â€one that must be stopped before it obliterates everything!  DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t miss this essential piece of the Boba Fett mythos written by Thomas Andrews (Star Wars: Empire) and illustrated with the eye-popping art of Francisco Ruiz Velasco (Lone Wolf 2100).
