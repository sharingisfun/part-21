Agnosticism is considered a cautious, tentative and scientific approach to the question of the existence of gods - Stefan Molyneux's seminal book &quot;Against the Gods?&quot; makes a powerful case against agnosticism and for the positive acceptance of the nonexistence of supernatural beings.\n\nIt is not rational to even entertain the possibility of the existence of irrational entities. We do not accept agnosticism about unicorns, fairies, square circles, pixies on the proposition that two and two make five Ã¢â‚¬â€œ why do we create a special exception in the realm of deities? Surely it is because the social cost of rejecting God's is far higher than the social cost of rejecting goblins.\n\n&quot;Against the Gods?&quot; provides essential ammunition to those fighting the virus of faith, and clears the mental fog of the irrational middle ground between atheism and theism.\n\nAbout the author:\nStefan Molyneux is a Canadian philosopher, author, speaker, and host of Freedomain Radio. Molyneux's areas of focus include libertarian political philosophy, voluntaryism based on the strict application of the non-aggression principle, secular ethics, strong atheism, cryptocurrency (Bitcoin), history, non-violent parenting, and familial relationship issues. He has written and self-published eight non-fiction books, and his essays have been published on libertarian websites such as LewRockwell.com and antiwar.com. He is a frequent public speaker at political and technology conferences and has appeared on television, radio, and podcasts to discuss his views. His online philosophy show, Freedomain Radio, has independently produced over 1,500 videos and 2,700 podcasts as of June 2014. Jeffrey Tucker of the Ludwig von Mises Institute described Molyneux as &quot;one of the single most influential libertarian thinkers of our times&quot;\nMore of his books can be found here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://freedomainradio.com/free/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://freedomainradio.com/free/&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37244267b4e2cb9c40f080538717adbf0cbf978a","amp;dn":"Stefan+Molyneux+-+Against+the+Gods+audiobook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37244267b4e2cb9c40f080538717adbf0cbf978a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,36,66,103,180,226,203,156,64,240,128,83,135,23,173,191,12,191,151,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
