Haven't seen volume 2 (Malibu, 7 issues) or volume 3 (SIRIUS, 4 issues). If you have them, please upload them!\n\nAll hail the original talent and scanners! Get it, seed it!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6bca9ce8441dde673d2249d3c142c05c34dfe44d","amp;dn":"Warlock+5+v1+COMPLETE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6bca9ce8441dde673d2249d3c142c05c34dfe44d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,202,156,232,68,29,222,103,61,34,73,211,193,66,192,92,52,223,228,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
