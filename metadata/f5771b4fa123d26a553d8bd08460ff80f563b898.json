The portrayals of Ickenham&amp;#039;s hapless relatives as they&amp;#039;re enmeshed in his nets of imposture and misdirection are classics of their kind. british narrator,Jonathan Cecil succeeds all around, reading expressively and slowly. His portrayal of Ickenham&amp;#039;s nephew, Pongo, who is reduced to trembling desperation by the earl&amp;#039;s antics, is particularly good. Immensely enjoyable listening. D.W.
