There are so many things happening on our planet, both act of God and all the disasters that human beings make. Very little difference in the initial condition affects everything and it becomes a big difference with time and it appears in front of us. Needless to say, it's not all about bad things. The future that DJ Krush and his guest artists visualize, as little things influence each other intricately... their Butterfly Effect is expressed in the new album","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a9fa3795fcaf3f9ae9e1be955cf94e5aa38315a","amp;dn":"DJ+Krush+-+Butterfly+Effect+%282015%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a9fa3795fcaf3f9ae9e1be955cf94e5aa38315a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,159,163,121,95,202,243,249,174,158,27,233,85,207,148,229,170,56,49,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
