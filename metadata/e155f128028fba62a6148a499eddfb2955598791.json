There are glorious harmonies, melodies to die for and the whole thing is a breath of fresh air in an over-angst-ridden market. Opening track Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ride It OutÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, indeed much of the album, has the feel of early Ryan Adams solo outings, only a little more acoustic. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also a life-affirming positive song, and there arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t that many of them about. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a proper country sweetness to the music and every track has a gorgeous hook or chorus and there are great harmonies as well from Ocean and Sarah Durning. One might invoke the spirit of Gram and Emmylou and not be guilty of hype.\nOcean has been around for a while, playing in bands, on other peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s records and so forth as well as producing two previous solo albums, but this is clearly the one where he hits his stride. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nary a weak spot to be heard. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Savannah RoseÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is drenched in steel and harmonica, the title track has echoes of CSN, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Last StandÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is proper country rock, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sapphire BlueÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ shivers the soul and OceanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lonesome aching vocals are powerful and moving throughout. There may be only eight songs and a total running time of barely thirty-six minutes but this is a perfectly distilled set that, once heard, has to be heard again. And again. And \nRating 8/10\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n01 Ride It Out\n02 Savannah Rose\n03 Bring It All In\n04 Last Stand\n05 Alarms\n06 Sapphire Blue\n07 Dashboard\n08 Rosa\n\n\nSummary:\nCountry: USA\nGenre: alt-country, folk-rock, singer-songwriter\n\n\nMedia Report:\nSource : CD\nFormat : FLAC\nFormat/Info : Free Lossless Audio Codec, 16-bit PCM\nBit rate mode : Variable\nBit rate : ~727-914 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\nBit depth : 16 bits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e155f128028fba62a6148a499eddfb2955598791","amp;dn":"%282014%29+Elijah+Ocean+-+Bring+It+All+In+%5BFLAC%2CTracks%5D+%7B100.XY%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e155f128028fba62a6148a499eddfb2955598791","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,85,241,40,2,143,186,98,166,20,138,73,158,221,251,41,85,89,135,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
