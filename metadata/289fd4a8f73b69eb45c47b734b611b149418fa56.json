Over the course of his seventeen-year teaching career in North America, Trungpa ushered in a radically new approach to spiritualityÃ¢â‚¬â€both rooted in the ancient wisdom of the buddhadharma and thoroughly situated in the contemporary world. His teachings, grounded in what he called the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Shambhala vision,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ focused on the development of an enlightened society through the transformation of ordinary, everyday life into sacred activity.\n\nSteering between Western biography and traditional Tibetan hagiography, Fabrice Midal takes you on a soaring journey through TrungpaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life and teachings. Touching on all of the most momentous events, this series of glimpses into ChÃƒÂ¶gyam TrungpaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s world provides a rare view on the formation of TrungpaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s thought and the remarkable body of teachings and writings that remain as his legacy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:289fd4a8f73b69eb45c47b734b611b149418fa56","amp;dn":"Chogyam+Trungpa%3A+His+Life+and+Vision","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"289fd4a8f73b69eb45c47b734b611b149418fa56","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,159,212,168,247,59,105,235,69,196,123,115,75,97,27,20,148,24,250,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
