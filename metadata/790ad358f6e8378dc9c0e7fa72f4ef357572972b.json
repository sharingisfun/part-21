Buoyed by their acclaim from their first Elektra album, as well as their association with Eric Clapton, the group switched record labels and recorded this, probably their most definitive album. Backed by an awesome cast of musicians which included Jim Gordon(drums),Kenny Gradney (bass) -- later of (Little Feat), and many others, this record shows why anyone connected with the band became a tambourine-shaking convert to soul-based rhythm &amp; blues rock. Some great vocal performances by Bonnie Bramlett, especially the low-down &quot;The Love of My Man,&quot; show why she was put in the same league as Janis Joplin. One of the more definitive albums of the period.\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.discogs.com/Delaney-Bonnie-Friends-To-Bonnie-From-&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.discogs.com/Delaney-Bonnie-Friends-To-Bonnie-From-&lt;/a&gt;\nDelaney/release/1199428\n\nOriginal APE files converted to FLAC via XLD.
