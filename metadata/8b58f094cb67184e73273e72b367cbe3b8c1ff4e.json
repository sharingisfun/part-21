For centuries the kingdom has been at odds with neighboring Nostria, but now first steps are being undertaken toward a lasting peace. But a plague of crows troubles the king, for the birds are acting with unusual aggressiveness, even attacking humans. Moreover, there are those among the citizens of Andergast who swear that the crows are bringing them dark nightmares.\n\nAs the belligerent creatures infiltrate even the castle itself, the king seeks a skilled bird catcher Ã¢â‚¬â€œ an opportunity for young Geron to prove that the reputation for ill luck that has followed him since childhood is undeserved. Following an audience with the king, the prestigious task is assigned to him. However, not only does his task prove unexpectedly difficult, but it also turns out to be the first step of the greatest adventure of his life, which will lead him to the borders of the charted lands of Aventuria and beyond.\n\n[b]Screens:[/b]\n\n[img]http://rapidimg.org/images/Dvr2c.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://rapidimg.org/images/Dvr2c.jpg[/img]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b58f094cb67184e73273e72b367cbe3b8c1ff4e","amp;dn":"The+Dark+Eye+Chains+of+Satinav-SKIDROW%5BEtGamez%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b58f094cb67184e73273e72b367cbe3b8c1ff4e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,88,240,148,203,103,24,78,115,39,62,114,179,103,203,227,184,193,255,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
