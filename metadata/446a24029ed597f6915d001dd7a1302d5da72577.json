A larger-than-life figure with his tattoos, piercings, waxed moustache and flamboyant attire, Drako Oho Zarharzar has lived quite the bohemian life, including a stint modelling for Salvador Dali. But two near-fatal accidents have left their mark on this septuagenarian, who now lives with a condition known as anterograde amnesia. So while he can recall events from the past, he struggles to form new memories. Much of the film is shot on a single camera in Drako's Brighton council flat, a hoarder's paradise filled to the rafterswith notes, rubbish and pictures of well-endowed men - in effect, the jumbled contents of Drako's brain made manifest. Not that the squalor (or anything else for that matter) bothers this man; Drako's unfailing belief in his creed &quot;Trust. Absolute. Unconditional.&quot; means that he remains untroubled by his helplessness. The genial Amies moves from being an impartial observer to a concerned friend and even a carer to this stubborn yet blissfully upbeat individual, whose infectious joie de vivre and rascally behaviour transcends what could have been a tragic story into something more life-affirming.\n\n \nVideo 852 x 478 / 25 fps / 1079 kbps / Mp4\n\nAudio 128 kbps AAC\n\nDuration 1:14\n\nSeed to the Max - you know it makes sense . . .\n\nSno\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt2402602&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt2402602&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe Man Whose Mind Exploded, Sno, Documentary, Biography, Drako Zarharzar\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI seed all of my torrents to a ratio of 100:1 - after that its your responsibility to keep them alive . . .\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRipped / Encoded / Uploaded by Snowhiter\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAny Bitcoin Donations - no matter how small Welcome here : 164BRZMwZZHmBHS7WLU2s4ZB3geRZZuV3b","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:446a24029ed597f6915d001dd7a1302d5da72577","amp;dn":"The+Man+Whose+Mind+Exploded+-+Sno","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"446a24029ed597f6915d001dd7a1302d5da72577","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,106,36,2,158,213,151,246,145,93,0,29,215,161,48,45,93,167,37,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
