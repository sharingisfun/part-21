In addition smaller station signs, lights and even the 'You're approaching the Strong Country' art deco posters are included at Alton and Alresford.\n\nThe route features authentic signalling, including semaphore signals between Alresford and Medstead stations and the new colour light signals at Alton. At Ropley the signals are modelled on the yet-to-be-commissioned signal diagram, as are some of the signals at Alton, so you can experience the signalling before even the real train crews have!\n\nBe sure to watch out for the AWS warnings along the route as all distant semaphore signals have permanent AWS ramps.\n\nThe line follows an accurate gradient profile, climbing out of Alresford at 1-in-80, which rises to 1-in-60 half way between Ropley and Medstead, then be prepared for a four-mile slog on the run back from Alton up another 1-in 60-gradient!\n\nTen enjoyable scenarios are included to keep you busy!\n\n\n\n\nPlease support the developers and buy some of their content if you can afford it.\n\n\nJoin Railworks Central for more addons, support and discussions at:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.railworkscentral.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.railworkscentral.com&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor support and requests email:\n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;55213034382125376130233027153238343c397b363a38&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\nIf you want to say thanks, contribute and share an addon with the community then email them to us...
