A tribe will do anything to protect their own. While on spring break from college, Native American Tara Eagle is kidnapped in a foreign land. Her tribe in the United States closed it's borders, declares war, and sends an unlikely team to rescue her. They were joined by others.\n\nCold River Rising is an action-filled and emotionally moving story of personal sacrifice, tribal loyalty, unflinching heroism, and the kind of pride and strengh of character that spans generations and helps bind a community together.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd9dfe862c83123be1f6e1ea51932c7ec2db52dc","amp;dn":"Cold+River+Rising+by+Enes+Smith+%7Bdwg%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd9dfe862c83123be1f6e1ea51932c7ec2db52dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,157,254,134,44,131,18,59,225,246,225,234,81,147,44,126,194,219,82,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
