MiklÃƒÂ³s RÃƒÂ³zsaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s score for the 1951 epic Quo Vadis is one of the biggest Ã¢â‚¬Å“holy grailsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ for soundtrack collectors, but the loss of the original music tracks has meant that the complete score, unencumbered by effects and/or archival sound quality, has been unavailable Ã¢â‚¬â€œ UNTIL NOW!\n\nProduced by James Fitzpatrick (Tadlow Records) for Prometheus Records, this 2CD CollectorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Edition of the complete score features previously unreleased music (including the complete 7-minute Ã¢â‚¬Å“Burning of RomeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ sequence and several cues that were dropped from the film), newly recorded in stunning and dynamic digital sound. From NeroÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s songs to arena hymns, from powerful Roman marches and fanfares to a gorgeous love theme, from colorful music at the Roman Bacchanale to fiery music for the burning of Rome, from the exultant Ã¢â‚¬Å“Main TitleÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to the ecstatic Ã¢â‚¬Å“FinaleÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all here! Over 136 minutes of classic and glorious RÃƒÂ³zsa, carefully reconstructed from the original studio scores by Leigh Phillips and excitingly performed by The City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra and Chorus under the baton of Nic Raine. Bonus tracks include the premiere complete stereo recording of RÃƒÂ³zsaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Quo Vadis Suite. The 28-page booklet, illustrated with film stills and recording session photographs, includes detailed and informative notes by Frank K. DeWald and background information on the recording by producer Fitzpatrick.\n\n\nCD1\n01. Overture (Intermezzo) [0:03:01.49]\n02. Main Title (Original Version) / Appian Way [0:02:25.59]\n03.
