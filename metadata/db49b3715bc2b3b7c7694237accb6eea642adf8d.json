ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s always amazing, always something new.\nThis is probably one of the most beautiful places IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve ever been, and IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve grown to love this entire place and all the people in it.... IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m speechless as to how amazing this has beenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“Chris Beards, 16\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWithout this program I would be stressed!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“Paris Cooper, 16\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe first two days I was in a rush to get back home, now I donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t even believe itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½everyone in this room, I wish they could stay here with me. This week has been so much fun! ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦I never knew breathing could make you so relaxed like that. I was in a deep sleep and I was mad ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“cause they woke me up! This camp gave me good visions of myself; like I pictured myself being in the NBA. And thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s something to live for. Also, IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve made good friends hereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½everybodyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s my friend!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“Wesley Chambers, 17\n\nBaltimore City\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI prayed to God for some release of my stress ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ somehow I was stressing out really bad about family issues and stuff in my life and then all of a sudden, the YES! program popped up at my school and I joined the class. When I stopped taking the class, I realized that it had relieved a lot of my stress. I was more friendly to people around me, and more relaxed and more focused on my work instead of real tense and stressed. The class gave me a chance to think before acting. I wanted to go to Canada to further the program because I wanted that same feeling. I have never been out of Baltimore and I have never done anything like this beforeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ - Tashana Sawyers, 16","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db49b3715bc2b3b7c7694237accb6eea642adf8d","amp;dn":"Sudarshan+Kriya+-+Sri+Sri+Ravi+Shankar+-+YES-Summer-Camp-Overvie","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db49b3715bc2b3b7c7694237accb6eea642adf8d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,73,179,113,91,194,179,183,199,105,66,55,172,203,110,234,100,42,223,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
