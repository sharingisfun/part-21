Joyce Hatto was a successful concert pianist who withdrew from performing in the 1970s. She suddenly re-emerged in 2003: new CDs began appearing, released on her husband's Concert Artists label, with recordings of a daunting range of pieces. \n\nHer husband, William Barrington- Coupe (interviewed here and a very plausible character) claimed she was working away at the piano even as she battled cancer. Critics and enthusiasts praised her recordings: &quot;Chopin Etudes - absolutely mind-blowing. Beethoven Bagatelles - amazingly good,&quot; recalls one. \n\nBut all wasn't quite as it seemed: were the recordings in fact lifted from other pianists? The full extent of the deception remains hard to unravel. But the film is an absorbing journey through a hall-of-mirrors story, one that throws a dim light on the close-knit world of classical connoisseurs. And you have to wonder, was there perhaps a clue to be had in the name of the label?\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ee75ea6466ede628239a2f5bf432dfd110132f6","amp;dn":"The+Great+Concert+Pianist+Swindle","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ee75ea6466ede628239a2f5bf432dfd110132f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,231,94,166,70,110,222,98,130,57,162,245,191,67,45,253,17,1,50,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
