Stationed in a remote area near the Canadian border, the troopers, avid pranksters with an affinity for syrup, have a knack for screwing up on the job. But when budget cuts in the town of Spurbury threaten their livelihood and pit them against arch-rival Spurbury P.D., the five friends try to straighten up and fly right. That is, until a dead body is discovered and a possible drug ring is unearthed. The super troopers spring into action attempting to solve the crime, save their jobs, and outdo the local police department.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c444863c17c95cf53eba70241e03500df6cec4cc","amp;dn":"Super+Troopers+2001+1080p+BRRip+WeedHD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c444863c17c95cf53eba70241e03500df6cec4cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,68,134,60,23,201,92,245,62,186,112,36,30,3,80,13,246,206,196,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
