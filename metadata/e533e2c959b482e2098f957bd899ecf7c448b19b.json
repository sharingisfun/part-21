The usage of nanosystems, nanomaterials, nano-devices, etc. permeates all aspects of society. Cancer targeting and curing nanosystems are being introduced into the biomedical and pharmaceutical industries; so are lightweight energy absorbing or blast-proof nanohybrid material in the aerospace, automotive and marine industries and high-efficiency energy harvesting nanomaterials, etc. Society has a vested interest in knowing how these new materials, devices and systems are changing the economy and similar landscapes. The book outlines the regulatory and environmental issues related to nanotechnology per industry, offers guidelines in assessing the risks and discusses the legal and socioeconomical issues involved. Case studies will be utilized to provide examples of the positive and negative impacts of nanotechnology.\n\nProvides an overview and the basis for understanding the critical importance of the reactivity and efficacy of nanomaterials and the emerging role of nanotechnology in societyExplains the fundamentals, ethics, regulatory and environmental issues of nanosafety and how they shape the emerging nanotechnology industry and markets and includes extensive lists of glossary terms, terminologies and concepts needed for Material Data Safety SheetsDiscusses the relevance and specificity of nanosafety issues per industry and includes discussions on the &quot;Homeland Security and Infrastructure Industries&quot; of interest to society in generalIncludes nanotechnology risk assessment and delineates and quantifies the risk assessment process for nanotechnology safety of paramount importance to most industries and systemsOutlines the legal and intellectual property ramifications of nanotechnology and its impact on productivity and society\n================\n\nDovah","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e533e2c959b482e2098f957bd899ecf7c448b19b","amp;dn":"Nanotechnology+Safety+Elsevier+epub+%5Bdovah%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e533e2c959b482e2098f957bd899ecf7c448b19b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,51,226,201,89,180,130,226,9,143,149,123,216,153,236,247,196,72,177,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
