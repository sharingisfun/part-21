Tom also has a son named Rusty, an Ã¢â‚¬Å“accident between the sheetsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ whose mother deserted them both years ago. The pair make an odd kind of family, with the bar their true home, but they manage just fine.\n\nUntil the summer of 1960, that is, when Rusty turns twelve. Change arrives with gale force, in the person of Proxy, a taxi dancer Tom knew back when, and her beatnik daughter, Francine. Is Francine, as Proxy claims, the unsuspected legacy of her and TomÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s past? Without a doubt she is an unsettling gust of the future, upending every certainty in RustyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life and generating a mist of passion and pretense that seems to obscure everyoneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vision but his own. The BartenderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Tale wonderfully captures how the world becomes bigger and the past becomes more complex in the last moments of childhood.\n\n\n\n\t  \t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5dccc56dfb72b82b28eb84db35be00be5d46e4e","amp;dn":"Ivan+Doig-The+Bartender%27s+Tale","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e5dccc56dfb72b82b28eb84db35be00be5d46e4e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,220,204,86,223,183,43,130,178,142,184,77,179,91,224,11,229,212,110,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
