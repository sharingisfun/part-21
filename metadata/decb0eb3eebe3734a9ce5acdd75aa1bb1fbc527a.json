How did they come to be the villains of the natural world? And why can the same plant be considered beautiful in some places but be deemed a menace in others?\n\nIn Weeds, renowned nature writer Richard Mabey embarks on an engaging journey with the verve and historical breadth of Michael Pollan. Weaving together the insights of botanists, gardeners, artists, and writers with his own travels and lifelong fascination, Mabey shows how these &quot;botanical thugs&quot; can destroy ecosystems but also can restore war zones and derelict cities; he reveals how weeds have been portrayed, from the &quot;thorns and thistles&quot; of Genesis to Shakespeare, Walden, and Invasion of the Body Snatchers; and he explains how kudzu overtook the American South, how poppies sprang up in First World War battlefields, and how &quot;American weed&quot; replaced the forests of Vietnam ravaged by Agent Orange.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:decb0eb3eebe3734a9ce5acdd75aa1bb1fbc527a","amp;dn":"Weeds%3A+In+Defense+of+Nature%27s+Most+Unloved+Plants","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"decb0eb3eebe3734a9ce5acdd75aa1bb1fbc527a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,203,14,179,238,190,55,52,169,206,90,205,215,90,161,187,31,188,82,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
