The aim is to present the fundamentals of linear algebra in the clearest possible way; pedagogy is the main consideration.  Calculus is not a prerequisite, but there are clearly labeled exercises and examples (which can be omitted without loss of continuity) for students who have studied calculus.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76c298769d67753061402f771b1166a3b8c0102a","amp;dn":"Elementary+Linear+Algebra%3A+Applications+Version%2C+11th+Ed+-+Anton","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76c298769d67753061402f771b1166a3b8c0102a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,194,152,118,157,103,117,48,97,64,47,119,27,17,102,163,184,192,16,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
