Uncertain about his purpose and why he was built, he wanders into the forest that surrounds the laboratory. This is where youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll first start to use your camera to take photographs of objects. The first chapter of the game will hit you with a series of puzzles involving moving objects around within the levels, and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s easier than you think. If you want to reposition a box, simply snap a photo to capture it, then paste the picture back into the world and watch the box fall back out of it.\nAs you progress through Snapshot youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll use the camera in new and interesting ways, like taking photographs of light and using it to interact with physics. Your camera even captures an objectÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s momentum. This, combined with the ability to rotate photographs as you paste them, leads to more complex and interesting gameplay. For example, if a snowball is falling when you snap a photo, the snowball will hurl upwards if you paste that photograph back into the world upside-down. You can even use this to take photographs of enemy projectiles and aim them right back at them! \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://farm9.staticflickr.com/8144/7296004982_647bab3310_z.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://farm9.staticflickr.com/8144/7296004982_647bab3310_z.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://download.gamezone.com/uploads/image/data/1108584/Snapshot_-_Feature.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://download.gamezone.com/uploads/image/data/1108584/Snapshot_-_Feature.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.retroaffect.com/_games/snapshot/featured.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.retroaffect.com/_games/snapshot/featured.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5107dc930fdcb6d6246dcd39d742245f5303bbfc","amp;dn":"Snapshot+-+Full+PreCracked+-+Foxy+Games","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5107dc930fdcb6d6246dcd39d742245f5303bbfc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,7,220,147,15,220,182,214,36,109,205,57,215,66,36,95,83,3,187,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
