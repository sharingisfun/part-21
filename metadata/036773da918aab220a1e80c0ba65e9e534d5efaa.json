It features call-and-response lyrics (especially common in Who lyrics at this time) and some of the first ever recorded guitar feedback. The song was composed by guitarist Pete Townshend and vocalist Roger Daltrey, the only time they wrote together. The guitar feedback, although not the first to be heard on a record (see The Beatles' &quot;I Feel Fine&quot;), is thought to be the first solo with feedback. This is the first Who release with Nicky Hopkins playing piano.\n\nThe Who are an English rock band that formed in 1964. Their best known line-up consisted of lead singer Roger Daltrey, guitarist Pete Townshend, bassist John Entwistle and drummer Keith Moon. They are considered one of the most influential rock bands of the 20th century and are one of the world's best-selling bands.\n\nThe three founder members of the Who, Roger Daltrey, Pete Townshend and John Entwistle, grew up in Acton, London. All three passed the Eleven plus exam and went to Acton County Grammar School. Townshend's father, Cliff, played saxophone and his mother, Betty, had sung in the entertainment division of the Royal Air Force during World War II. Entwistle's father, Herbert, played trumpet, and his mother, Queenie, played piano. Townshend and Entwistle became friends in their second year of Acton County, and formed a trad jazz group, the Confederates, while Entwistle also played french horn in the Middlesex Schools' Symphony Orchestra. Both became influenced by the increasing popularity of rock 'n' roll, and Townshend particularly admired Cliff Richard's debut single, &quot;Move It&quot;. Entwistle had decided to move to guitar as his instrument of choice, but after struggling with it due to his large fingers, and on hearing the guitar work of Duane Eddy, decided to move to the bass. He was unable to afford his own instrument and built one at home. After Acton County, Entwistle went to work with the Inland Revenue, while Townshend started a course at Ealing Art College, a move that he later described as profoundly influential on the course of the Who.\n\nThe Who are one of the most influential rock bands of the 20th century.\n\nThe Beatles were fans of the Who and appreciated their live sound when on tour. Paul McCartney was inspired to write Helter Skelter in the &quot;heavy&quot; style of the Who, while John Lennon borrowed the acoustic guitar style in &quot;Pinball Wizard&quot; for Polythene Pam.\n\nThe Who have been called &quot;The Godfathers of Punk&quot; with several proto punk and punk rock bands citing them as an influence, including the Sex Pistols, The Clash, the MC5, The Stooges, the Ramones and Green Day. In turn, the Who inspired mod revival bands particularly the Jam, which helped other groups directly influenced by the Who become popular. In the mid-1990s, Britpop bands such as Blur and Oasis were influenced by the Who.\n\nThe Who have received numerous awards and accolades from the music industry, both for their recorded output and their influence. They received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the British Phonographic Industry in 1988,[348] and from the Grammy Foundation in 2001, for creative contributions of outstanding artistic significance to the field of recording.[248]\n\nThe group were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990 where their display describes them as &quot;prime contenders, in the minds of many, for the title of World's Greatest Rock Band&quot;, and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005. Seven of the groups' albums have appeared on Rolling StoneÃ¢â‚¬Å 'Ã¢â‚¬â€¹s The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, more than any other act with the exceptions of the Beatles, Bob Dylan, the Rolling Stones and Bruce Springsteen.\n(video has white timecounter numbers across the top)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anyway,_Anyhow,_Anywhere#B_side&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anyway,_Anyhow,_Anywhere#B_side&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/BagBIaaga&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/BagBIaaga&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x480 (4:3) 29.97fps 9641kbps\n   Audio: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz stereo 448kbps\n   Duration: 00:03:22\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
