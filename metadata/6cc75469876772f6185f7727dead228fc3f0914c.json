John Cleese, Graham Chapman, Terry Jones, Eric Idle, Terry Gilliam and Michael Palin have returned to explain The Meaning of Life. These naughty Brits offer the usual tasteful sketches involving favorite body parts and bodily functions, the wonders of war, the miracle of birth and a special preview of what's waiting for us in Heaven. Nothing is too sacred for the probing Python crew. You'll never look at life in quite the same way again. Time pronounces it &quot;an exhilarating experience!&quot; Newsweek agrees, calling it, &quot;the best movie from England's satirical sextet.&quot; Winner of the 1983 Cannes Film Festival Special Jury Award.\n \n \nDisc 1\nFeature Presentation\nRun Time: 1 Hour 48 Minutes\nMPAA Rating: R\nBonus Materials\n\nPrologue with Eric Idle \nDirector's Cut \nFeature Commentary with Terry Jones and Terry Gilliam \nSoundtrack for the Lonely \n Technical Information\nAudio\n\nEnglish Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround \nFrench Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono \nEnglish DTS 5.1 Surround \nCaptions: English\nSubtitles: French, Spanish\nPicture: Anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1)\nColor \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n Disc 2\nBonus Materials\nBonus Materials\n\nSnipped Bits \nThe Meaning of Making The Meaning of Life \nEducation Tips \nUn Film de John Cleese \nRemastering a Masterpiece \nSong and Dance \nSongs Unsung \nTrailer \nTV Spots \nUS Promotion \nRejects \nUK Radio \nTelepathy \nVirtual Reunion \nWhat Fish Think \nDVD-ROM Features Including The Screenplay, The Lost Scenes, The Song Sheets and The Fat Recipes \n  \n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6cc75469876772f6185f7727dead228fc3f0914c","amp;dn":"The+Meaning+of+Life+-+Monty+Python+%5BEdition+Limited%5D+%5B2+DVD%5D%5BRat","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6cc75469876772f6185f7727dead228fc3f0914c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,199,84,105,135,103,114,246,24,95,119,39,222,173,34,143,195,240,145,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
