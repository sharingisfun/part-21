Aside from attracting former heartthrobs, the musical stands as being one of the most approachable musicals based on religious materials. A rather straightforward telling of the tale of Joseph, the favorite son of Jacob also known as &quot;Israel&quot;, Joseph the musical has catchy songs and colorful characters not to mention their costumes, making it a favorite of parents who want to take their children to a Broadway show. For anyone who's read the Bible, the story is predictable, although author Tim Rice has taken several liberties with the Good Book. Highlights in the score include &quot;Close Every Door,&quot; &quot;Go Go Joseph,&quot; &quot;One More Angel in Heaven,&quot; and &quot;Any Dream Will Do.&quot; For some, Andrew Lloyd Webber's music might be a bit too saccharine, but on a whole the show is fun, buoyant, and energetic.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49004683c343fc477134bb30eebb556fd53bd341","amp;dn":"Joseph+And+The+Amazing+Technicolor+Dreamcoat+%28OBC+1982%29+%5Bflac%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49004683c343fc477134bb30eebb556fd53bd341","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,0,70,131,195,67,252,71,113,52,187,48,238,187,85,111,213,59,211,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
