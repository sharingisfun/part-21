Organist Charles Earland and his sextet, which includes trumpeter Virgil Jones, Houston Person, on tenor and guitarist Melvin Sparks, perform a variation of &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot; titled &quot;Black Talk,&quot; two originals, a surprisingly effective rendition of &quot;Aquarius,&quot; and a classic rendition of &quot;More Today Than Yesterday.&quot; Fans of organ combos are advised to pick up this interesting set. \n\nCharles Earland - Organ\nHouston Person - Tenor\nVirgil Jones - Trumpet\nMelvin Sparks - Guitar\nIdris Muhammad - Drums\nBuddy Caldwell - Congas\n\n01.
