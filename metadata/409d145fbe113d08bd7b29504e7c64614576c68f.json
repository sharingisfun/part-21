Father Ted captured a specific Irish humour rarely seen\n      on screen and its impact doesn't seem to have faded. The show is\n      revealed as a product of a pair of ambitious writers, a\n      brilliant cast and the gently confident producer Geoffrey\n      Perkins, whose suggestion of turning a one-off mock documentary\n      into a sitcom helped make it the much-loved show it is today.\n      Ardal O'Hanlon, Frank Kelly, Graham Norton and many others pitch\n      in with their reminiscences of the show, the passion it inspired\n      and their memories of the late, great Dermot Morgan.\n      \n     \n                                                      Group Notes...\n        We are looking for:                           \n                                                                     \n      .EU Affil sites, NO COLO/RENTED.                              \n                                                                     \n      Retail TV dvds before the retail date.                        \n                                                                     \n      Can't get in contact with us?
