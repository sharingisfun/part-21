Marshall\n\nBoy, somebody knew what they were doing here. The sound is pristine, obviously from first-generation tapes and balanced superbly, with every glorious Nashville moment as if recorded in your own living room. But the great selection is also the thing; these are generally lesser-known, even obscure Orbison numbers, though several rank with his very best. &quot;Distant Drums&quot;, &quot;Beautiful Dreamer&quot; and &quot;No One Will Ever Know&quot; are prime Orbison-Fred Foster work, and &quot;(I'd Be A) Legend In My Time&quot; - fabulous Nashville production with strings, cascading piano, rising chorus, Boots Randolph's mournful, bluesey sax solo, the classic Don Gibson melody, Roy's magnificent vocal soaring over all of it, and a solitary bell note in the middle, to boot - is not only Orbison-Foster's finest moment, but a model testament for the Nashville Sound genre. Not an all-comprehensive selection of Roy Orbison by any stretch, but a great introduction to his best stuff, the Monument years, at a great price. But why not a better, more accurate photo of Roy from, say, the early sixties - when most of these were recorded - than the aging geezer in disco duds that somebody thoughtlessly slapped on the cover of this otherwise admirable collection?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3dbcb2f2b5dcd50d7b0e0e8c63eeea1b41920ab6","amp;dn":"Roy+Orbison+Best-Loved+Standards+320cbr+%28Big+Papi%29+1989+CBS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3dbcb2f2b5dcd50d7b0e0e8c63eeea1b41920ab6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,188,178,242,181,220,213,13,123,14,14,140,99,238,234,27,65,146,10,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
