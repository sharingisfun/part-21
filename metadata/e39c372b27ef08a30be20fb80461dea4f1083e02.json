Early in his life he was a vagabond and petty criminal, but later took to writing.\n\nHis explicit and often deliberately provocative portrayal of homosexuality and criminality was such that by the early 1950s his work was banned in the United States. Jean-Paul Sartre wrote a long analysis of Genet's existential development (from vagrant to writer) entitled Saint Genet (1952).\n\nOur Lady of the Flowers (Notre Dame des Fleurs) is Genet's first novel (1943). The free-flowing, poetic novel is a largely autobiographical account of a man's journey through the Parisian underworld. The characters are drawn after their real-life counterparts, mainly gay and living on the fringes of society.\n\nThe Balcony is Genet's best-known play, which has attracted many of the greatest directors of the 20th century. Set in an unnamed city that is experiencing a revolutionary uprising, most of the action takes place in an upscale brothel that functions as a microcosm of the regime of the establishment under threat outside.\n\nYou can download in various formats a collection of critical essays on Genet's work at http://www.archive.org/details/excursiondelaso00morigoog.\n\nYou can view Genet's 25-minute silent film Un Chant d'Amour at http://www.ubu.com/film/genet.html. (UBU.com is an incredible archive of avant-garde materials.) Definitely not suitable for work, by the way.\n\nThese two books are in MOBI/Kindle format.\n\nPlease seed, and check my torrents for other more unusual/offbeat books. I will never upload a Stieg Larsson book, I promise... not that there's anything wrong with his books, but there seem to be a hundred torrents for them.
