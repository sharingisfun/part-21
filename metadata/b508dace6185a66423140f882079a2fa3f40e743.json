When this album was eventually issued on CD for the first time in the early 1990s, the 6 songs from the 50's were restored to original monaural sound.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢The album wasn't a strong seller when it was first released in 1975. \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢It was certified Gold 9/12/1977, Platinum 3/20/1988 and 2x Platinum 3/27/1992 by the R.I.A.A. \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢The front cover photo features Elvis from his ' Aloha from Hawaii' concert in 1973. \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢In Europe the album was released, with a differend cover, in RCA's ' Take-Off ' series. \n\nReleased now in a stunning 3- panel digipack is an Alternate Album Of 'Pure Gold'.
