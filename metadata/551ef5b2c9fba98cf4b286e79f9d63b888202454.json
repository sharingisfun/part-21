He creates and plays music using authentic and modernized Lithuanian folk as well as electronic instruments; sessional musicians are also invited to cooperate. The project is distinguished for its solid, subtle and mature sound of modern music with Baltic touch. The debut album ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDeinainaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ was released in a tape format in 1998, it was followed by a CD ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBaltos Juodos KlajosÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWhite Black WandersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ , Dangus prod . 2002), the famous work ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â vilpiaiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWhistlesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, 2003), a joint project of DONIS with KÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ÂªLGRINDA ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSotvarasÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (Dangus prod.), an ambient album ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œVacuumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (Autarkeia, 2004), a post-folklore album ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBite LingoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and antic &quot;Alexandreia&quot; (Autarkeia, 2007).\nFrom 1994 until now, DONIS collaborates with various projects: Wejdas, Notanga, KÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â«lgrinda, etc. Lately, Donatas pays much attention to electronic and experimental music. A wish and potentiality to experiment not only with ambient/folk music reveals itself in a project d.n.s.\n\n*About Donis*\n\n||| Giedrius KupreviÃƒâ€žÃ‚ï¿½ius (composer, dean of the Faculty of Humanities at Kaunas University of Technology):\nAt these disturbing times of cultural transformation there are people that strive to preserve the cells of fundamental feelings and senses. DonisÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ progression returning to the section of antediluvian cultural mentality is a successful attempt to convey to us the sounds of that section. Donis&amp;#039; ability to play with modern and archaic expression delights and comforts: his albums are an attestation of these abilities.\n\n*Official Website of the Artist*\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.donis.lt&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.donis.lt&lt;/a&gt;\n\n---\n\n||| Deinaina\nMC, 1998\nReleased by Donis (mp3; CBR 128 kb/s)\n\n&quot;Deinaina&quot; in Prussian means &quot;morning star&quot;.

In ten compositions of the album, profoundness of archaic chants subtly blends with original contemporary music arrangements.\n\nThe chants were sung by a professional vocalist Rasa Serra. Pure and intense, gently flowing vocals of this singer from the seaside endues the songs of &quot;Bite lingo&quot; with overpowering beauty, and distinguishes her among other folklore performers. Ancient chants revive seized by majestic and graceful DonisÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“ sound architecture and spellbinding post-folk rhythms. As in previous albums, the music of the project assumes nearly ritualistic sense.\n\nIt is the fifth album of DONIS, and it is based on military ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ historical folklore that the author had been interested in for several years. The journey to the space of the Baltic essence starts and finishes with the voices of Klaipeda folklore ensemble KURSIU AINIAI (the leaders are Jolita Vozgirdiene and Deividas Krutkevicius). Atmospheric, psychedelic guitar runs of Jevgenij Sege elevate the sound of the album, and the sounds of kankles and violin folds it in tranquillity and cosiness. Dignity and profoundness of extant heathen chants reveals itself through original modern acoustic aesthetics.\n\nOne of the brightest modernized songs &quot;An krantelio akmenelis&quot; was already presented to the audience in the contemporary Baltic music compilation &quot;Amber Tribes&quot;, and was also included in a release &quot;The Singing Land: Contemporary Folk Music from Lithuania 2005&quot; representing Lithuanian post-folklore in the international cultural fair MIDEM. The album also contains two electronical remixes of the title track &quot;Bite lingo&quot; created by DonatasÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“ colleagues, famous representatives of experimental music Driezhas and McKaras.\nCD &quot;Bite lingo&quot; is released as a deluxe digipack\n\nLyrics by folk [historic war folklore songs, except 4]\nDonatas Bielkauskas ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ music [2, 4, 5, 7] and\nauthentic melodies arrangements [1, 3, 6, 10]\nRecorded in Klaipeda 2000ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“2005\nMastering McKaras\nDesign by Gys\nLogo graphics by Algis Klisevicius\nReleased by Dangus [DGCD 018]\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¾Bite lingoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ was performed by:\nRasa Serra [www.rasaserra.com] ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ vocals [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\nKlaipeda folklore ensemble &quot;Kursiu ainiai&quot; (leaders Jolita Vozgirdiene and Deividas Krutkevicius) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ vocals [1, 10]\nJevgenij Sege ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ el.guitar [3]\nJolita Vozgirdiene ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ traditional kanklÃƒâ€žÃ¢â‚¬â€s [1]\nDeividas Krutkevicius ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ violin [6]\nMcKaras ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ &quot;Bite lingo&quot; mix version [8]\nKristijonas Lucinskas ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ &quot;Bite lingo&quot; mix version [9]\nDonatas Bielkauskas ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ programming, sampling, mixing, keyboards, birbyne, lumzdelis, zvanguliai, svilpis (folk instruments), percusion, effects\n\nCompositions:\n\n1.

This time the artist has embarked on a new challenging journey, that is, to compose music revealing the unknown spirit of antiquity. His efforts have resulted in Alexandreia album that serves as a deep, pure and dreamy manifest to the ancient times. Tranquil, transparent and persuasive ambient stream prevails in the tracks. The archaic winds of different nations tastefully add to it in some of the tracks. These include hornpipe, bagpipes, mesmerising rhythms of tabor and mystifying bells. Soft and velvety voice of vocalist Alwyda, who has created the key vein of the album, opens the idealised femininity of the antiquity and conveys emotionally-charged world vision of genius Konstantin Kavafi where the Mediterranean past and present, the East and the West, the Greeks and the barbarians meet in the catharsis of profound sadness and wisdom, where the fall of civilisation witnessed in the vanishing cultural heritage is revealed. The Greek poetry recited in an enchanting voice and the ambient melting the words with elemental force embrace the audience who do not even know the archaic language. Alexandreia album will not disappoint the lovers of Dead Can Dance, Kameras 48, Raison DÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢etre music, either.\nInfo: Autarkeia.org\n\nPoetry: Constantine P.
