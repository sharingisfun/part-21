Download and install any DVD mounting program, such as the free Daemon Tools Lite or the more diverse Alcohol 120%: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4826678/Alcohol_120__v1.9.8.7530_Patch(latest)_%5B_kentuckykiid_%5D&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4826678/Alcohol_120__v1.9.8.7530_Patch(latest)_%5B_kentuckykiid_%5D&lt;/a&gt;\n\n2. Open the .iso file with the program.\n\n3. Make sure the program created a virtual disc drive. You'll see this within My Computer. It'll typically claim to be an HD-DVD drive, or a Blu-ray drive; depending on the program you use.\n\n4. Mount the file using the program to the virtual disc drive. On Alcohol 120%, you can do this by just right-clicking the file within the program and selecting the option to mount it. If the movie doesn't play automatically, go to My Computer and double-click the virtual drive. Your default DVD-playing program should open up.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the program to burn the .iso to a blank DVD, and then it will be playable on any typical DVD player.\n\n\nLike Van Halen a lot?
