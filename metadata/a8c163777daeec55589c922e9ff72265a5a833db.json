It is time for a new approach.\n\nWe call on Governments and Parliaments to recognise that:\n\nFifty years after the 1961 UN Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs was launched, the global war on drugs has failed, and has had many unintended and devastating consequences worldwide.\n\nUse of the major controlled drugs has risen, and supply is cheaper and more available than ever before. The UN conservatively estimates that there are now over 250 million drug users worldwide.\n\nIllicit drugs are now the third most valuable industry in the world, after food and oil, all in the control of criminals. Fighting the war on drugs costs the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s taxpayers incalculable billions each year. Millions of people are in prison worldwide for drug-related offences, mostly personal users and small-time dealers.\n\nCorruption amongst law-enforcers and politicians, especially in producer and transit countries, has spread as never before, endangering democracy and civil society. Stability, security and development are threatened by the fallout from the war on drugs, as are human rights. Tens of thousands of people die in the drug war each year.\n\nThe drug-free world so confidently predicted by supporters of the war on drugs is further than ever from attainment.The policies of prohibition create more harms than they prevent. We must seriously consider shifting resources away from criminalising tens of millions of otherwise law abiding citizens, and move towards an approach based on health, harm-reduction, cost-effectiveness and respect for human rights.\n\nEvidence consistently shows that these health-based approaches deliver better results than criminalisation. Improving our drug policies is one of the key policy challenges of our time. It is time for world leaders to fundamentally review their strategies in response to the drug phenomenon.\n\nAt the root of current policies lies the 1961 UN Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs. It is time to re-examine this treaty, which imposes a Ã¢â‚¬Å“one-size-fits-allÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ solution, in order to allow individual countries the freedom to explore drug policies that better suit their domestic needs.\n\nAs the production, demand and use of drugs cannot be eradicated, new ways must be found to minimise harms, and new policies, based on scientific evidence, must be explored.\nLet us break the taboo on debate and reform. The time for action is now.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8c163777daeec55589c922e9ff72265a5a833db","amp;dn":"Breaking.The.Taboo.2012.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8c163777daeec55589c922e9ff72265a5a833db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,193,99,119,125,174,236,85,88,156,146,46,159,247,34,101,165,168,51,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
