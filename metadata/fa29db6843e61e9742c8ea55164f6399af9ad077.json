And in GodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s name why?\n\nLewis Black has the answers. Or at least his answers. He survived Hebrew school and a bar mitzvah (barely), was a sixties college student who saw the parallels between religious rapture and drug-induced visions (even if none of his friends did), explored the self-actualization movement of the seventies (and the self-indulgence it engendered), and turned a cynical eye toward politicians who don the cloak of religious rectitude to cover up their own hypocrisy.\n\nWhat he learned about the inconsistencies and peculiarities of religion infuriated Black, and in Me of Little Faith they get his full comic attention. In a series of comedic inquiries, Black explores how the rules and constraints of religion have affected his life and the lives of us all. Hilarious experiences with rabbis, Mormons, gurus, psychics, and even the joy of a perfect round of golf give Black the chance to expound upon what we believe and whyÃ¢â‚¬â€in the language of a shock jock and with the heart of an iconoclast.\n\nPlease seed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa29db6843e61e9742c8ea55164f6399af9ad077","amp;dn":"Lewis+Black","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa29db6843e61e9742c8ea55164f6399af9ad077","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,41,219,104,67,230,30,151,66,200,234,85,22,79,99,153,175,154,208,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
