It uses science and mathematics to expand the research base of Pacific prehistory and casts new light on this final human expansion. It explores the fundamental roles of oceanography and of global climate change in determining the paths, sequence, timing and range of Spice Island-based maritime migrations ranging across a quarter of the globe.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c515c215cbd625d4de50a79240cb05bdb78f4e6","amp;dn":"Oceanic+Migration","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c515c215cbd625d4de50a79240cb05bdb78f4e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,81,92,33,92,189,98,93,77,229,10,121,36,12,176,91,219,120,244,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
