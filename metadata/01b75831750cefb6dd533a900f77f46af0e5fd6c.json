In the past were songs like Being Boring, West End Girls, Rent, It's A Sin etc... which are for the most part, mid-tempo electronic rock. Very reminds me a lot of the direction that OMD went after McCluskey and Humphreys went separate ways, think Sugar Tax and Liberator era. Of course most people are familiar with Can You Forgive Her which was a pretty big hit back in the early 90's, but after the opening track finishes off, you're hit with I Wouldn't Normally Do This Kind Of Thing, a straight up dancy disco rocker. The pace of this album rarely lets up except for a few slower ballady songs (Liberation, Dreaming of the Queen, To Speak Is A Sin) and finishes off with an outstanding version of the Village People's Go West. I like this album a lot, it is one of my favorites because it is so upbeat and energetic, and of course because the Pet Shop Boys are incredible. I would recommend this album to fans of newer OMD, New Order, Erasure, Intuition, Neuropa","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01b75831750cefb6dd533a900f77f46af0e5fd6c","amp;dn":"Pet+Shop+Boys+-+Very+%5BFlac%5D%5BTntVillage%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01b75831750cefb6dd533a900f77f46af0e5fd6c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,183,88,49,117,12,239,182,221,83,58,144,15,119,244,106,240,229,253,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
