Rebelling against her fatherâ€™s films of passion, intrigue, and spirits from beyond, Severin starts making documentaries, traveling through space and investigating the levitator cults of Neptune and the lawless saloons of Mars. For this is not our solar system, but one drawn from classic science fiction in which all the planets are inhabited and we travel through space on beautiful rockets. Severin is a realist in a fantastic universe.\r\n\r\nBut her latest film, which investigates the disappearance of a diving colony on a watery Venus populated by island-sized alien creatures, will be her last. Though her crew limps home to earth and her story is preserved by the colonyâ€™s last survivor, Severin will never return.\r\n\r\nAesthetically recalling A Trip to the Moon and House of Leaves, and told using techniques from reality TV, classic film, gossip magazines, and meta-fictional narrative, Radiance is a solar system-spanning story of love, exploration, family, loss, quantum physics, and silent film.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRead by Heath Miller\r\nFormat: MP3\r\nBitrate: 32 Kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:98b458d9e120c929d056f316fb967121e06596b1","amp;dn":"Catherynne+M.+Valente+-+Radiance","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"98b458d9e120c929d056f316fb967121e06596b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,180,88,217,225,32,201,41,208,86,243,22,251,150,113,33,224,101,150,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
