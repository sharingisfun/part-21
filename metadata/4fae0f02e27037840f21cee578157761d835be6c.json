He visits a pawn shop in Chinatown to buy Wuxia DVDs and discovers a golden staff. On his way home, Jason is harassed by some hooligans, who attempt to use him to help them rob the shop-owner Hop. Hop tries to fight the thieves with the staff, but is shot and wounded. He tells Jason to deliver the staff to its rightful owner and Jason flees with the staff. He is cornered on the rooftop by the hooligans and almost shot too, but he is pulled off the roof by the staff and falls backwards onto the asphalt. When Jason regains consciousness, he finds himself in a village in ancient China that is under attack by armored soldiers. The soldiers see his staff and attempt to seize it. He is saved by the inebriated traveling scholar Lu Yan, a supposed &quot;immortal,&quot; who remains alert and agile even when drunk. Lu brings Jason to a teahouse and tells him the story of the rivalry between the Monkey King and the Jade Warlord. The Jade Warlord tricked the Monkey King into setting aside his magic staff Ruyi Jingu Bang and transformed him into a stone statue, but the Monkey King cast his staff far away before the transformation. Being an immortal, the Monkey King did not die, but got captured inside the statue. Lu ends the tale with a prophecy about someone, a &quot;Seeker&quot;, who will find the staff and free the Monkey King. Just then, they are attacked by the Jade Warlord's men again but manage to escape with the help of Golden Sparrow, a young girl who refers to herself in the third person. She reveals that her family was murdered by the Jade Warlord, against whom she has therefore sworn revenge.\n\nGenre: Action | Adventure | Fantasy\n\nRelease date: 9 July 2008 (UK)\n\n\nCode:\n\nJackie Chan\nJet Li\nCollin Chou\nLiu Yifei\nLi Bingbing\nMichael Angarano\n\n::General::\n\nComplete name: The Forbidden Kingdom 720p BRrip\nFormat: Matroska\nFile size: 1722.42 MiB\nDuration: 1h 44mn\nOverall bit rate: 2 306 Kbps\n\nContainer: AVC\nVideo Codec Type: x264 - core 114 r1913 5fd3dce\nAverage video bitrate: [/b]\n[b]Frame Rate: 23.976 fps\nEncoding type: 2 Pass\nDisplay Aspect Ratio: 2.35:1\nResolution: 1280x544\nSource: Blu-ray\n\nAudio Language: English\nAudio Codec: AAC\nBitrate: %Audio_Bitrate%\nChannel Count: 6 channels\nSample Rate: 48.0 KHz\n\nGREETZ: To all my fellow HDScene Encoders, DarkScene, blackjesus and all other Releasers we respect....You know who you are.\n\nscreens\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/91548322536673886591.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/91548322536673886591.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/77982944532015508299.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/77982944532015508299.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/54548775418457362661.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/54548775418457362661.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/54111765957566230390.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/54111765957566230390.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/29787474235723930089.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/29787474235723930089.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/67364683125955456208.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/67364683125955456208.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFollow us on Facebook\n\nFollow us on Twitter \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4fae0f02e27037840f21cee578157761d835be6c","amp;dn":"The+Forbidden+Kingdom+720p+BRrip+x264+aac+vice+%28HDScene+Release%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4fae0f02e27037840f21cee578157761d835be6c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,174,15,2,226,112,55,132,15,33,206,229,120,21,119,97,216,53,190,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
