These comics feature several celebrated independent and underground artists who are let loose in the Marvel Universe and allowed to make it their own playground, with some fascinating results. Each issue is an anthology of short stories; notable contributors include Harvey Pekar, Gene Luen Yang, Peter Bagge, Stan Sakai, Kate Beaton, Becky Cloonan and more. \n\nThis torrent contains the following:\n-Strange Tales I [Marvel Knights] 01-03 (2009-2010, Digital-Empire)\n-Strange Tales II [Marvel Knights] 01-03 (2010-2011, Digital-Empire)\n-All Select Comics 70th Anniversary Special 01 (2009) (two covers) (Minutemen-Sha-Hic!)

Fear not, Friends of Old Marvel - you haven't fallen prey to the illusions of Loki. You've simply discovered Strange Tales II! A band of the best and brightest talents in independent, alternative and online comics joins forces with the Earth's Mightiest Heroes for a sequel to the acclaimed Strange Tales anthology, one that critics are calling &quot;better than any of the previous run&quot; (Douglas Wolk, Time.com's Techland). Hilarious, haunting and horrifying (sometimes all at once), it's Marvel gone strange!&quot;\n\nBooklist review - &quot;A truly strange anthology indeed, this excellent collection gathers some of the top names in alternative comics and unleashes them on the Marvel universe. Similar to the DC parodies in Bizarro Comics (2002), these fresh takes on MarvelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s classic characters include some weird, humorous, often psychedelic results. Among the off-kilter best are Dr. StrangeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s psychic battle at a diner over a poisoned bowl of soup, by Dash Shaw (BodyWorld, 2010); the oddly touching rework of the Hulk as a grumpy child, by James Kochalka (American Elf); autobiographical true-farceur Jeffrey Brown re-imagining the Fantastic Four as a group of bored pranksters; a restrained Johnny Ryan (Angry Youth Comix) envisioning the Punisher telling an at-risk youth to stay in schoolÃ¢â‚¬â€or else; and droll genre parodist Jason making anthropomorphic animals out of Spider-Man and Doc Octopus getting into a bar fight. Though longtime alt-comics fans will be thrilled to see Peter BaggeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“lost comicÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ The Incorrigible Hulk finally in print, the real winner here is Maakies creator Tony MillionaireÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s completely whacked Iron Man adventure: the troubled hero (Millionaire would pick a reformed alcoholic) goes head-to-head with the nefarious Baloney-Head and his sidekick, Liver-Wurst Face (with a surprise appearance by Dwight D. Eisenhower!). Weird and totally unique, Strange Tales is like seeing your favorite heroes and villains in a fun-house mirror, with the emphasis on fun.&quot; -Carlos Orellana\n\nThanks and credit go to Empire for the digital copies of the Strange Tales issues and Minuteman-Sha-Hic! for the scan of the Special. Please seed, and enjoy! :-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80f7ec89fe79a1544643a4598f81f66799be2b37","amp;dn":"Strange+Tales+I+%26amp%3B+II+%2B+Ex+%5BMK+MAX%5D+%282009-2011%7CDigital-Empire","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80f7ec89fe79a1544643a4598f81f66799be2b37","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,247,236,137,254,121,161,84,70,67,164,89,143,129,246,103,153,190,43,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
