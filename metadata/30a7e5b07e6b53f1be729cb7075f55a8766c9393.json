The story is set in an environmentally ravaged, desolate future. For the first time in 40 years the warring New Territories and the Federal Republics have reached a tentative peace thanks to the secret machinations of the Central Union, a powerful group comprised of industrialists from both sides. As part of the deal, the Central Union is allowed to monopolize all communications. Anne, the pregnant wife of New Territories army training officer Leo Megaw, works for CU as one of their leading security coders. To prove her prowess, she one day decides to prove to her skeptical boss that she can crack his supposedly uncrackable security code. In so doing she learns that an outer security zone has suffered a terrible accident resulting in deadly contamination.\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo: XviD, 720x392, 23.976 fps, 2051 Kbps, 01h35m27s\r\nAudio: MP3, 48000 Hz, stereo, 128 kbps\r\n\r\nDVDRip, English audio, optional Bulgarian subtitles\r\n\r\ncover: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/nvkqlkf0p/\r\n\r\nscreenshots: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/4fg8x6bjj/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/5t7vshasv/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/cv5teoeen/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/6lajroezz/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:30a7e5b07e6b53f1be729cb7075f55a8766c9393","amp;dn":"Zone+39+%281996+-+Australia%29+post+apocalypse+sci+fi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"30a7e5b07e6b53f1be729cb7075f55a8766c9393","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,167,229,176,126,107,83,241,190,114,156,183,7,95,85,168,118,108,147,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
