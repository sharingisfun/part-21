Downloading all 26 torrents will give you a total of 687 releases to sample.  I pray that you find it in your hearts to support the Artist and their Message by buying the originals, should you like anything you download through these torrents.\n\nThere are some great albums in this 26th bundle today.  Kari Jobe has an all acoustic release, KB has dropped an awesome &quot;Weights And Glory&quot; tape, Amber Bullock's much anticipated album is finally here, the always controversial Matisyahu has a new reggae release, Group1Crew has teamed up with Chris August for the &quot;He Said&quot; single that I've finally been able to find, Hillsong College came out with their very own worship project, and I've been playing the gospel and soul sounds of BJ Hardy since I added it to my own personal collection a week or so ago.\n\nMore specifically, the 25 titles in this 26th bundle include...\n\n * 808 And Elite - 2012 - Diamonds X Pearls\n * Amber Bullock - 2012 - So In Love\n * BJ Hardy - 2012 - With All My Heart EP\n * Blake Goss - 2012 - Love Has Spoken EP\n * Brotha Minista - 2012 - I Will Survive\n * Capital Lights - 2012 - Rhythm N Moves\n * CD Porter - 2012 - Declaration\n * Da Messenger - 2012 - Lifeline\n * DJ Official - 2012 - I Didn't Invent The Remix\n * Erik Thien - 2012 - Fiat Lux\n * Euclid Gray - 2012 - Just As I Am\n * Glory Collective, The - 2012 - Shine EP\n * Group1Crew - 2012 - He Said - Single\n * Hamilton G - 2012 - The Power\n * Hillsong College - 2012 - The Project\n * Kari Jobe - 2012 - The Acoustic Sessions Live EP\n * KB - 2012 - Weight And Glory\n * Matisyahu - 2012 - Spark Seeker\n * Positive Music - 2012 - Persecuted For Christ\n * Ruthie Foster - 2012 - Let It Burn\n * Sherwin Gardner - 2012 - Nascent\n * Stephen Fryrear - 2012 - At The Cross EP\n * TeTe - 2012 - Outta My Witts\n * Travis Malloy - 2012 - Travis Malloy\n * Young Chozen - 2012 - Night Light\n\nPlease continue to seed for a little longer than you perhaps otherwise would.
