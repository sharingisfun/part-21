Enterprise is charting the space just beyond the edge of the galaxy, the starship becomes caught in the hypergravitational pull of the dead star known as Questar M-17. Narrowly avoiding a collision with the massive and deadly stellar object, Captain James T. Kirk\\&amp;#039;s crew settles the Enterprise into orbit around Questar, whereupon they discover a highly advanced and awe-inspiringly beautiful alien ship that dwarfs even the Federation\\&amp;#039;s mightiest starships.\n \nThe enormous alien vessel appears to be some three hundred million years old, and looks utterly dead. Protected by life-support belts, Kirk, First Officer Spock, Dr. McCoy, and Chief Engineer Scott beam over to the ancient ship, where the boarding party discovers that the vessel was built by insectoid people who had become locked in a struggle against an invasive, hostile, and noncorporeal life form ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ which the team inadvertently brings back with them to the Enterprise. \n\nThis life form, an organism composed of electromagnetic energy, orders Kirk to take it to the center of the galaxy. Where it plans to spread itself far and wide, taking over every ship it encounters. Playing a cosmic game of \\&quot;chicken,ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ Kirk instead sends the Enterprise heading straight toward the heart of Questar M-17 on an apparent collision course, thus forcing the entity to flee his ship an instant before a gravitational \\&quot;sling-shot effectÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ carries the starship to safety. The creature, however, remains gravitationally trapped in orbit about the dead star, pleading with Kirk not to leave, and filling the cosmos with its plaintive wails of loneliness.\n\n\nVideo Attribute\n*****************\n  Video compression mode...............: Xvid\n  TV system (NTSC/PAL).................: NTSC\n  Aspect ratio.........................: 720x480\n  Source picture resolution............: 720x480\n  Frame rate...........................: 29.972\n\n-------- Subpicture attributes --------\n  Number of subtitles..................: 1\n  Subtitle language/s..................: N/A\n\n\nAudio Attribute \n*****************\n  Audio coding mode....................: AC-3 ACM Decompressor\n  Sampling rate........................: 24 bit\n  Number of audio channels.............: 2\n  Bitrate..............................: 448 kbps\n  Number of audio streams..............: 1\n  Audio stream language/s..............: English\n\n\nRIP Information \n*****************\n  Video (Untouched/Re-encoded-%).......: Untouched\n  Audio (Untouched/Stripped)...........: Untouched\n  Menus (Untouched/Stripped)...........: Stripped\n  Extras (Untouched/Stripped/N/A)......: Stripped\n  Subtitles (Untouched/Stripped/Added).: Added\n\n\nPost Information\n*****************\n  Posted by............................: Payine InDa\\&amp;#039;Azz\n  Compression method (RAR/ZIP).........: AVI\n  File validation......................: N/A\n  Part size............................: 213 MB\n  Name of the part files...............: 1\n  Number of files......................: 2\n  Total files size.....................: 213 MB\n  Burn tested..........................: yes\n  Date of post (d.m.y).................: 10.10.2007\n  Posted to............................: The Pirate Bay\n  Re-posting policy....................: Please Seed\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6ee4282c80f8ec84101a36510b545c1a7b5f3df","amp;dn":"Star+Trek+-+The+Animated+Series+-+S01E01+Beyond+the+Farthest+Sta","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6ee4282c80f8ec84101a36510b545c1a7b5f3df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,238,66,130,200,15,142,200,65,1,163,101,16,181,69,193,167,181,243,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
