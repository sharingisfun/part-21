(how is it possible to put on 4 pounds in the middle of the night? Could flesh have somehow solidified becoming denser and heavier? Repulsive, horrifying notion), alcohol units 4 (excellent), cigarettes 21 (poor but will give up totally tomorrow), number of correct lottery numbers 2 (better, but nevertheless useless)...&quot;\n\nBridget Jones' Diary is the devastatingly self-aware, laugh-out-loud daily chronicle of Bridget's permanent, doomed quest for self-improvement Ã¢â‚¬â€ a year in which she resolves to: reduce the circumference of each thigh by 1.5 inches, visit the gym three times a week not just to buy a sandwich, form a functional relationship with a responsible adult, and learn to program the VCR.\n\nOver the course of the year, Bridget loses a total of 72 pounds but gains a total of 74. She remains, however, optimistic. Through it all, Bridget will have you helpless with laughter, and Ã¢â‚¬â€ like millions of readers the world round Ã¢â‚¬â€ you'll find yourself shouting, &quot;Bridget Jones is me!&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff855c91407ace72702b079dc20e85f869e1f321","amp;dn":"Bridget+Jones%27s+Diary+%5BBridget+Jones%2C+%231%5D+-+Helen+Fielding.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff855c91407ace72702b079dc20e85f869e1f321","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,133,92,145,64,122,206,114,112,43,7,157,194,14,133,248,105,225,243,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
