This act is so good they were even engaged by David Gilmour to perform at his 50th birthday celebration! \n\nDuring an eveningÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s festivities at the Fulham Town Hall, performing Pink Floyd to the members of Pink Floyd amongst others. Toward the end of the performance Pink Floyd bassist Guy Pratt joined the band on stage along with Rick Wright for a rendition of 'Comfortably Numb'. This was followed by David Gilmour, Gary Wallis, Tim Renwick and Claudia Fontaine along with Guy and Rick, performing a number of edited versions of Floyd songs including 'Money' and 'What Do You Want From Me'. It was an incredible \nending to an unbelievable night.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:412c2b2bdf1edcf16810773c8f2bc2e46f8a638b","amp;dn":"Australian+Pink+Floyd+-+2004-07-16+-+King%27s+Dock+Arena+-+Liverpo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"412c2b2bdf1edcf16810773c8f2bc2e46f8a638b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,44,43,43,223,30,220,241,104,16,119,60,143,43,194,228,111,138,99,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
