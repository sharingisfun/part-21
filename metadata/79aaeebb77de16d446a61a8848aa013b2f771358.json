Two very different roads. The choice will change everything.\n\nEven as a pregnant, unwed teen in 1974, Sandy Lincoln wanted to do the right thing. But when an ageless woman approached her in a convenience store with a mysterious prophecy and a warning, doing the right thing became even more unclear. She made the best choice she could . . . and has lived with the consequences.\n\nMore than thirty years later, a pregnant teen has come into her life, and Sandy's long-ago decision has come back to haunt her. The stakes rise quickly, leaving Sandy with split seconds to choose once more. But will her choice decision bring life . . . or death?\n\n&quot;&quot;The Choice&quot; shows the struggles of unplanned pregnancy and the courageous act of adoption in a way that I haven't read before . . .&quot; --Abby Brannam-Johnson, former Planned Parenthood Director and author of &quot;Unplanned&quot;\n\n&quot;Whitlow captures the struggle of many women trapped in the battle over abortion in a truly sympathetic and affecting way.&quot; --&quot;Booklist&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79aaeebb77de16d446a61a8848aa013b2f771358","amp;dn":"The+Choice+-+Robert+Whitlow.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79aaeebb77de16d446a61a8848aa013b2f771358","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,170,238,187,119,222,22,212,70,166,26,136,72,170,1,59,47,119,19,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
