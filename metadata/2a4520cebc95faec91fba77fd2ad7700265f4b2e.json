We told him to make a TV show, and this is what he came back with. Well, what else would you expect from the surreal Geordie stand-up? Once again, Ross pulls on his helmet, climbs onto his beloved motorbike, opens up Twitter and puts his fate entirely in the hands of his 500,000+ followers to decide every step of his journey. Like his stand-up routines Ross tosses out the script (and the rulebook) as he revs up his bike to discover the sort of experiences, and people that you'd never normally hear about.\n\nTechnical Spec\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;175a767e79575b243926&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nVideo Bitrate: CRF 22\nVideo Resolution: 832x468\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\nFrames Rate: 25 FPS\nAudio Codec: AAC-LC\nAudio Bitrate: Q=0.42 VBR 48KHz (~128Kbps)\nAudio Channels: 2\nRun-Time: 44 mins\nNumber Of Parts: 6\nPart Size: 503 MB (average)\nSource: PDTV\nEncoded by: JungleBoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a4520cebc95faec91fba77fd2ad7700265f4b2e","amp;dn":"Freewheeling.Series2.1of6.PDTV.x264-MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a4520cebc95faec91fba77fd2ad7700265f4b2e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,69,32,206,188,149,250,236,145,251,167,127,210,173,119,0,38,95,75,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
