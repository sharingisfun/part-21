The year is 1942: The German army has devastated the city of Stalingrad in the Soviet Union, prompting a band of brave Russian soldiers to make their last stand in a strategic building on the bank of the Volga. When the cornered soldiers encounter a pair of Russian women who failed to flee before the German assault, an unlikely romance emerges against the backdrop of the defining battle that will ultimately become a crucial victory for the Allied forces -- but not before five months of ferocious fighting. Thomas Kretschmann, Petr Federov, and Yanina Studilina star.
