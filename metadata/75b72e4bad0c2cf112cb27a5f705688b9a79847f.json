It also discusses the removal of consumer sales law from its traditional realm of legal professionals to consumer and debt advisors and public officials with the power to seek injunctions to protect consumers. In addition to this, it:\n\n    * fully integrates both the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive 2005 and the Consumer Credit Act 2006 into the basic 1974 Act\n    * explains how the sale of Goods Act 1979 has been modified by the 1999 Directive\n    * combines the public protection of consumers under the Enterprise Act 2002 (e.g. Office of Fair Trading)\n    * is supplemented by comprehensive e-updates on its Companion Website, keeping the content current between editions.\n\nWritten by an author with forty years experience of teaching sales and finance law to undergraduates, this textbook is an essential tool for all undergraduates studying commercial and consumer sales law.\n\n\n\n# Paperback: 1152 pages\n# Publisher: Routledge-Cavendish; 2 edition (December 26, 2006)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0415415667\n# ISBN-13: 978-0415415668","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:75b72e4bad0c2cf112cb27a5f705688b9a79847f","amp;dn":"Consumer+Sales+Law%2C2nd+Edition+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"75b72e4bad0c2cf112cb27a5f705688b9a79847f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,183,46,75,173,12,44,241,18,203,39,165,247,5,104,139,154,121,132,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
