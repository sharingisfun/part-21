Winner of the Pulitzer Prize, Justice has been hailed by his contemporary Anthony Hecht as Ã¢â‚¬Å“the supreme heir of Wallace Stevens.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ In poems that embrace the past, its terrors and reconciliations, Justice has become our poet of living memory. The classic American melancholy in his titles calls forth the tenor of our collective passages: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bus Stop,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Men at Forty,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dance Lessons of the Thirties,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Small White Churches of the Small White Towns.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ This master of classical form has found in the American scene, and in the American tongue, all those virtues of our literature and landscape sought by Emerson and Henry James. For half a century he has endeavored, with painterly vividness and plainspoken elegance, to make those local views part of the literary heritage from which he has so often taken solace, and inspiration.\n\nPaperback: 304 pages\nPublisher: Knopf (May 2, 2006)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 037571054X\nISBN-13: 978-0375710544\n\nSee a tiny collection of my torrents.
