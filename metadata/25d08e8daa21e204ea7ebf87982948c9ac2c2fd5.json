The audience is attentive and appreciative -- as they should be, for the communication between the two masterful players (on such songs as &quot;Milano,&quot; &quot;Django,&quot; &quot;I Love You,&quot; and their encore, &quot;The Summer Knows&quot;) is quite special. (AllMusic)\n\nTrack list:\n01. Elsa (7:47)\n02. Milano (4:39)\n03. Venutian Rhythm Dance (4:26)\n04. Django (6:11)\n05. Minha (All Mine) (4:10)\n06. Driftin' (5:11)\n07. I Love You (6:37)\n08.
