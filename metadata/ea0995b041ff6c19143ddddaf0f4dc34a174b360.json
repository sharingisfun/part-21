JJ's acoustic folk-pop vocal style has been compared to artists such as Natalie Merchant and Alanis Morissette. Her music resonates with conviction and reaches listeners with its refreshingly simple quality. &quot;We don't want to just entertain people,&quot; JJ says. &quot;We also want to inspire them and challenge them to ask the important questions in life.\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n01.
