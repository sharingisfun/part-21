While some of this shoegaze-inspired approach made it into his trip-hop-influenced project Apples to Earth, Emanuel continued to write moodier songs that he felt needed a different vocal approach. Enter singer/lyricist Anna Bouchard, a longtime friend with whom Emanuel began collaborating in 2010. By January of 2011, the duo was ready to record its self-titled EP, which was released in June. A few months later, Emanuel and Bouchard added guitarist Sean Evans and bassist Mike Brewer joined the fold, and the group signed to the Fort Worth, Texas-based label Saint Marie Records, which reissued an expanded version of the Drowner EP early in 2012 in anticipation of the band's full-length debut.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6dce988ba5d2061fc235887aa526edfca061712","amp;dn":"Drowner+-+Drowner+EP+%282012%29+%5BFLAC%5D+politux","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6dce988ba5d2061fc235887aa526edfca061712","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,220,233,136,186,93,32,97,252,35,88,135,170,82,110,223,202,6,23,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
