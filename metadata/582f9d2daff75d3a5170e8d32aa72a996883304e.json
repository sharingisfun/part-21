Re-seeding from scratch....\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is the latest installer for Milviz's newest T-38A jet trainer add-on for FSX/FSX-SE/P3Dv3+.    To be clear, this is the new ADVANCED version with built-in failure modules and external flight dynamics engine.    A very fun little rocket to fly, albeit with a steep practical flying learning curve (a good thing for we serious simmers).     This version seems to have finally ironed-out a lot of the quirks that previous versions of the T-38 by Milviz have always seemed to have, while at the same time ramping up the flight model fidelity and realism bars.    Yay.     \r\n\r\nDISCLAIMER: This was found 'elsewhere' and simply shared on here by me.    Any and all credit goes to the original uploader and cracker for sharing this (bless your bones).    A minimal effort for me to upload the torrent, but A LOT of effort by the original sharer/cracker.     THANK YOU fellow pirate!    :)\r\n\r\nNote: If you have any previous versions of the Milviz T-38 currently installed on your setup, re-run your original installer and use the menu to uninstall beforehand.   Milviz's uninstallers are built into their installers in other words, instead of having a standalone uninstaller","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:582f9d2daff75d3a5170e8d32aa72a996883304e","amp;dn":"%5BFSX%2FP3D%5D++Milviz+T-38A+ADVANCED+v3.151218+%28Fixed+Torrent%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"582f9d2daff75d3a5170e8d32aa72a996883304e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,47,157,45,175,247,93,58,81,112,232,211,42,167,42,153,104,131,48,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
