It was their first studio album in five years, since 1990's The Razors Edge. The album featured the return of Phil Rudd, who had been fired from the band in 1983 as a result of drinking and drug problems and a feud with Malcolm Young. It was produced by prolific producer Rick Rubin, who had briefly worked with AC/DC in 1993 to produce their single &quot;Big Gun&quot; for the soundtrack to the film Last Action Hero.\n\nProduction started at the Record Plant Studios in New York City, but the band became dissatisfied with the sound there and moved to Los Angeles' Ocean Way Studios.\n\nTwo weeks into the US leg of the Ballbreaker World Tour, four gigs were cancelled so that Brian Johnson could attend his father's funeral. During the tour, MTV cartoon characters Beavis and Butthead appeared in the intro during concerts. Five of the album's songs were played live: &quot;Hard as a Rock&quot;, &quot;Boogie Man&quot;, &quot;Cover You in Oil&quot;, &quot;Hail Caesar&quot;, and &quot;Ballbreaker&quot;.\n\nMP3 - 320kbs\n  \nNo. \t \t\n1. \t&quot;Hard as a Rock&quot;   \t      4:31\n2. \t&quot;Cover You in Oil&quot;   \t      4:32\n3. \t&quot;The Furor&quot;   \t              4:10\n4. \t&quot;Boogie Man&quot;   \t              4:07\n5. \t&quot;The Honey Roll&quot;   \t      5:34\n6. \t&quot;Burnin' Alive&quot;   \t      5:05\n7. \t&quot;Hail Caesar&quot;   \t      5:14\n8. \t&quot;Love Bomb&quot;   \t              3:14\n9. \t&quot;Caught with Your Pants Down&quot; 4:14\n10. \t&quot;Whiskey on the Rocks&quot;        4:35\n11. \t&quot;Ballbreaker&quot;                 4:31\n\nPlease Dont Hit And Run !\n\nAnd Please Feel free to Comment, Reguest and tell me what you like :D","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7a40c5c8991d2ed6dd56a394cc92e23914cc885","amp;dn":"AcDc+-+1995+-+Ballbreaker+%5B320kbs%5D+%7E%7ERenovatio%7E%7E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7a40c5c8991d2ed6dd56a394cc92e23914cc885","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,164,12,92,137,145,210,237,109,213,106,57,76,201,46,35,145,76,200,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
