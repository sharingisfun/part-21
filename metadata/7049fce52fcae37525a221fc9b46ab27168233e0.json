In Reel Power, Matthew Alford shows that it is in fact deeply complicit in serving the interests of the most regressive US corporate and political forces. Films like Transformers, Terminator: Salvation and Black Hawk Down are constructed with Defence Department assistance as explicit cheerleaders for the US military, but Matthew Alford also emphasises how so-called 'radical' films like Three Kings, Hotel Rwanda and Avatar present watered-down alternative visions of American politics that serve a similar function. Reel Power is the first book to examine the internal workings of contemporary Hollywood as a politicised industry as well as scores of films across all genres. No matter what the progressive impulses of some celebrities and artists, Alford shows how they are part of a system that is hard-wired to encourage American global supremacy and frequently the use of state violence.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7049fce52fcae37525a221fc9b46ab27168233e0","amp;dn":"Reel+Power%3A+Hollywood+Cinema+and+American+Supremacy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7049fce52fcae37525a221fc9b46ab27168233e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,73,252,229,47,202,227,117,37,162,33,252,155,70,171,39,22,130,51,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
