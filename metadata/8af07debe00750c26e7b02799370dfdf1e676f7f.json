In the conflict's darkest days, both the U.S. and Germany scramble to achieve nuclear capabilities. And if Hitler's scientists hand him the atomic bomb first, the world will be his. Hand-picked and trained by OSS chief &quot;Wild Bill&quot; Donovan, Captain James Cantrell is expected to do the impossible. He must parachute alone into ravaged Poland, and into the jaws of the Nazi beast, to rescue an aging scientist who's been marked for extermination.\nWith the Russians racing to capture the same prize, one wiry and tough ex-Oklahoma cop faces the most tragically difficult choice he's ever had to make. If the SS realize the value of Professor Jahne's secrets, their war is as good as won. So the fragile old genius must accompany Cantrell out of the countryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½or else he must die.\n\nAbout the Author:\nCharles Sasser is a retired veteran who spent twenty-nine years in the U.S. Army, thirteen of them as a Green Beret.
