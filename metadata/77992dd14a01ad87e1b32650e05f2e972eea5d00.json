I'm Casey Kasem, this is American Top 40, and on we go.&quot;\n\n\nAmerican Top 40 with Casey Kasem aired on radio from July 4, 1970 until August 6, 1988. This recording is a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this countdown:\n\nDan Fogelberg has his first to 40 hit (&quot;Part Of The Plan&quot; at number 40).\n\nIn 1970 a new group hit number 1 with their first song that featured a very distinctive vocal, and made the top 40 with their next 10 releases. When they broke up, the lead singer missed the top 40 in his first three attempts, but his fourth, the one that did it, is in this countdown.\n\nThere is a song by a man who once received two paychecks in the same day: one from the army for 145 dollars, and one from his record company for 850,000 dollars.\n\nA listener asks, &quot;Has any artist ever knocked himself out of the number one spot?&quot; Casey says only 2 acts have ever done it in the rock era, and each did it twice.\n\nThere is a group who released a single two years prior, and watched it bomb. But it wouldn't stay down. That song is in this countdown.\n\n40: Part Of The Plan - Dan Fogelberg\n39: Emotion - Helen Reddy\n38: Chevy Van - Sammy John\n37: I Get Lifted - George McCrae\n36: Hey Won't You Plan Another Somebody Done Somebody Wrong Song - B.J.
