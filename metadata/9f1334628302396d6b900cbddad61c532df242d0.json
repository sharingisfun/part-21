Both had made their first appearances on stage as sidemen in the Swedish and Danish jazz scene during the 1980s. In 1993, bassist Dan Berglund joined the duo, and the EsbjÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rn Svensson Trio was born. The trio released its debut album, When Everyone Has Gone, in 1993, and in the following years established itself in the Nordic jazz scene. Svensson was nominated for Swedish Jazz Musician of the Year in 1995 and 1996. (wikipedia)\n\nLike so many American players, Sweden's Esbjorn Svensson has backed his share of pop artists but is essentially a jazz improviser at heart. Svensson's enthusiasm for improvisation came through loud and clear on his Dragon dates of the 1990s, one of which was the decent When Everybody Has Gone. Backed by fellow Swedes Dan Berglund (bass) and Magnus Ostrom (drums), Svensson favors the piano trio format and draws on post-bop influences like Chick Corea, Bill Evans and Keith Jarrett on the standard Stella By Starlight and originals ranging from the pensive 4 a.m. to the melancholy Waltz for the Lonely Ones and the Middle Eastern-influenced Mohammed Goes to New York. Much of Svensson's work tends to be introspective and impressionistic, but things get surprisingly funky and almost Horace Silver-ish on Tough Tough. \n\n- - -\n\nEsbjÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rn Svensson Trio - When everyone has gone 1993\n(Stockholm Dragon)\n\n 1.
