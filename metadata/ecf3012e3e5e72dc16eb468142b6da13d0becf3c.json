There are no fantasy and science fiction books, though: those will be the object of a separate torrent.\r\n\r\n[b]Formats[/b]\r\nThe books are mainly in .epub and .pdf, because I don't own a Kindle and I dislike the very idea of a proprietary format and e-reader which binds you as its slave, in exchange for the low price. I usually go for ereaders which support the greatest number of formats. \r\n\r\nNaming\r\n======\r\n\r\nThe folders are by authorâ€™s surname. As for the files themselves, my naming convention is different than found in collections that come from Calibre. I donâ€™t like it when the books are by book title and not by author, because then if you donâ€™t have enough books by the same person to make a special author folder, finding what you want is much easier if all works by the same author are grouped together.\r\n\r\nSources\r\n=======\r\n\r\nThese are not my own scans or OCR. They have been collected over many years from the web, either from huge messy book torrents containing a bit of everything or from free download sites such as gutenberg, and a bunch of them came with my e-readers. \r\n\r\nMy only merit is organizing. I picked those which belong to this category from the chaos of most book torrents, and renamed them consistently to prune out doubles and make search easy. Iâ€™ve taken out meaningless folder numbers, deleted .opf and other useless files. In many cases Iâ€™ve added a .txt file with info about authors, added authorâ€™s year of birth and death. \r\n\r\nYou might find some books twice: usually because one is a scan of a regular book and the other one with the blown-up font used for e-readers, or sometimes one will include a cover and the other wonâ€™t. .. things like that. The collection is not compressed, so if these things donâ€™t matter to you, feel free to skip downloading one of the two","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ecf3012e3e5e72dc16eb468142b6da13d0becf3c","amp;dn":"American+literature+-+fiction+books+from+1800+to+1950","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ecf3012e3e5e72dc16eb468142b6da13d0becf3c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,243,1,46,62,94,114,220,22,235,70,129,66,182,218,19,208,190,207,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
