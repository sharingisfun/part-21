Malian singer Issa Bagayogo reaffirms this commonality on Timbuktu, finding the middle ground between traditional West African music--created with his six-stringed lute, acoustic guitars, and the djembÃƒï¿½Ã‚Â¹--and modern down-tempo electronic programming that wouldn't be out of place at the Buddha-Bar or any other hip club in Paris or New York. Amidst this gentle and hypnotic fusion, Bagayogo maintains the griot tradition of teaching and politics, singing about such issues as racial tolerance, regional pride amidst the globalization of culture, and drug abuse among Mali's youth. Bagayogo presents his ideas in an evenly modulated midrange voice with ethereal-sounding female backup singers who answer and reaffirm many of his lyrics with haunting effectiveness. All in all, this seductively laid-back album is another chapter in the ongoing tradition of great Malian music.\n-- amazon.com\n\nTracks\n01- Sisi\n02- Baro\n03- Tounga\n04- Nogo\n05- Timbuktu\n06- Dambalou\n07- Toroya\n08- Saye Mogo Bana\n09- Banani\n10- Gnele\n11- Tamagnoko\n12- Dama\n\nFormat: FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://flac.sourceforge.net/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://flac.sourceforge.net/index.html&lt;/a&gt; \n\nEnjoy, seed and inhale!\n\nLegalise it!\n\nPastafari Cubensis &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&lt;/a&gt;\nProud Member of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://venganza.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://venganza.org&lt;/a&gt;\n\nYou too can search for evidence the Flying Spaghetti Monster is the Lord and Master of the Universe  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://setiathome.berkeley.edu&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://setiathome.berkeley.edu&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e904fb8d7cb67092980e8c55a41346d5560bb79","amp;dn":"Issa+Bagayogo+-+Timbuktu+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e904fb8d7cb67092980e8c55a41346d5560bb79","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,144,79,184,215,203,103,9,41,128,232,197,90,65,52,109,85,96,187,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
