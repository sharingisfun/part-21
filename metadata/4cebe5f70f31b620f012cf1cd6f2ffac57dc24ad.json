The show was hosted by comedian Russell Brand who started his radio career in 2002 on a Sunday afternoon show on Xfm. Russell's co-host was long-term friend, Matt Morgan who had worked with Brand on other TV projects. Noel Gallagher was also described by Russell, as a third, unofficial, co-host.\nEach show was concluded by a summing-up poem by Mr Gee. The show originally featured contributions from comedian Trevor Lock, who left in March 2007 to pursue other projects including his own show on BBC 6 Music.\nHowever Russell Brand's show ended when he resigned due to complaints from the public over his, and his guest Jonathan Ross' prank calls to veteran actor Andrew Sachs.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4cebe5f70f31b620f012cf1cd6f2ffac57dc24ad","amp;dn":"The+Complete+Russell+Brand+Radio+Show++December+2005-October+200","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4cebe5f70f31b620f012cf1cd6f2ffac57dc24ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,235,229,247,15,49,182,32,240,18,207,28,214,242,255,172,87,220,36,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
