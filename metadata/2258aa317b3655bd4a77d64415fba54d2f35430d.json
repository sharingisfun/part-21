This may (even more broadly) be the first shÃ…ï¿½jo anime as well. The first magical girl manga was Himitsu no Akko-chan but it took longer to be adapted into an anime. Both series deal with henshin style transformations (such as Sailor Moon), but neither is the first anime to feature this.\n\nSally is the witch princess of the Magic Kingdom who longs to visit the mortal realm - presumably to make friends her own age. One day, Sally teleports to the &quot;mid world&quot; (Earth), where she uses her magic to fend off a couple of burglars menacing two young schoolgirls. Immediately befriended by her new acquaintances - tomboyish Yoshiko Hanamura (known affectionately as &quot;Yotchan&quot;) and girly Sumire Kasugano - Sally decides to stay on indefinitely, leading to various kinds of mischief. As with Samantha Stevens in Bewitched, Sally tries to keep her supernatural abilities secret, assuming the role of a human child.\n\nIn the final episode, Sally's grandma informs her she must return to the Magic Kingdom. Before leaving, Sally tries to tell her friends about her origins but no one will believe her. Then her elementary school catches on fire, and Sally uses her magic to put out the fire. Her powers thus exposed, Sally's time to leave has finally come. She waves farewell to her friends, and returns to the Magic Kingdom. The 2nd series ended with the movie/TV special Sally the Witch: Mother's Love is Eternal, in which Sally becomes queen of the Magic Kingdom, but worries about leaving her friends behind. The main strength of Sally the Witch lays in its strong characterizations and detailed continuity. The basic storyline would be incorporated into many later magical girl programs, particularly the concept of a magical princess relocating to the human world","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2258aa317b3655bd4a77d64415fba54d2f35430d","amp;dn":"Mahou+Tsukai+Sally+%281966%29+%5BTSHS%26amp%3BAV%5D+episode+01%28v2%29+%5B314F5FA9","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2258aa317b3655bd4a77d64415fba54d2f35430d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,88,170,49,123,54,85,189,74,119,214,68,21,251,165,77,47,53,67,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
