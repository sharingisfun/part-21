The helicopter can speed through the start up and shut down sequences on its own or the pilot can follow on-screen prompts through the start up/shut down sequences as the helicopter highlights each function on the 2D panels as they are required.\n\nAircraft systems will fail according to misuse. This may take several flights to occur as wear information is accrued and recorded. The pilot is able to clear persistent wear and damage using a virtual ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œService WorkshopÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ or switch off wear and damage completely.\n\nYour aircraft can be equipped with low skids, high skids or floats and there is also a high skid utility version with a working cargo hook. Each version can be selected with or without doors too but remember that this will significantly affect the aircraft's performance. \n\nThe package includes 2 different fuel management systems. The accurate startup procedures are not simple click sequences but dynamic systems affected by temperature altitude and most importantly, pilot error!&quot;\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMore Information: http://www.dodosim.com/fsx206.html\n\n\nFILE CONTENTS: \n\n- Dodosim 206 FSX.msi\n\nJust install it and fly!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74afbb48a6e0e5278b101c8c559dab84907adda4","amp;dn":"FSX+-+Dodosim+206","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74afbb48a6e0e5278b101c8c559dab84907adda4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,175,187,72,166,224,229,39,139,16,28,140,85,157,171,132,144,122,221,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
