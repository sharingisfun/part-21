Burke (CRC, 2013).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 9781439849866\r\n\r\nThe third edition of a bestseller, Hazardous Materials Chemistry for Emergency Responders continues to provide the fundamentals of &quot;street chemistry&quot; required by emergency response personnel. Emergency response and hazmat expert Robert Burke takes the basics of chemistry appropriate for response personnel and puts it into understandable terms. The author has retained the style and format that made the previous editions so popular while updating the information to keep the book relevant.\r\n\r\n\r\nSee Whatâ€™s in the Third Edition:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExpanded section on Ethanol and its hazards to responders\r\n\r\nUpdate of NFPA 472 Chemistry requirements\r\n\r\nRevised section on &quot;hazmat elements&quot; with more hazards and response issues\r\n\r\nIncludes a focus on the importance of the &quot;hazmat elements&quot; of chemical families\r\n\r\nNew incident examples\r\n\r\nNew photographs and graphics\r\n\r\n\r\nThe chapters are organized by the nine U.S. Department of Transportation's hazard classes. Almost every hazardous material presents more than one hazard; the DOTâ€™s placarding and labeling system only identifies the most severe hazards. Therefore, the book provides additional information about hidden hazards for each hazard class. It discusses individual chemicals, their hazards and their physical and chemical characteristics, both as distinct chemicals and within chemical families.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe book offers a concise presentation of the topics of most importance to emergency responders on a day-to-day basis. It provides the basic chemistry a responder needs to understand chemical terminology and communicate with others about the chemicals involved in hazardous materials incidents","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f470a355ae6976ab4ea54db5916ef354f28470e3","amp;dn":"Hazardous+Materials+Chemistry+for+Emergency+Responders+3rd+ed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f470a355ae6976ab4ea54db5916ef354f28470e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,112,163,85,174,105,118,171,78,165,77,181,145,110,243,84,242,132,112,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
