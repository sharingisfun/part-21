The great ballad performances here include &quot;Moonlight in Vermont,&quot; Eckstine's pitch control glowing in the final notes, and a superb version of Erroll Garner's &quot;Misty.&quot; \nA flexible small band, with pianist Bobby Tucker responsible for the arrangements and musical direction, supports Eckstine wonderfully. Trombonist Bucky Manieri has a good solo spot on &quot;I Want a Little Girl&quot; and Eckstine himself plays convincing trumpet solos on &quot;Lady Luck&quot; and &quot;'Deed I Do.&quot; --Stuart Broomer (Amazon)\n\n\n\nBilly Eckstine had one of the sweetest voices in jazz singing. This CD is his best record in print. While many of his best songs appear on his &quot;The best of the M-G-M years: Everything I have is yours&quot;, this CD is even better. \nThis CD contains outstanding standards from the best songbooks (Kern, Ellington and a few of Rodgers and Hammerstein's best songs, including the almost hymn &quot;You'll never walk alone&quot;). The Excellent remastering of this CD (much better than the mentioned compilation of &quot;The best of the M-G-M years&quot;) enables to fully enjoy the great baritone. In addition, 12 of the 21 tracks in this CD were previously unissued. \nIf you're interested in Jazz or Jazz singing you'll enjoy every minute.
