Their new lead singer, Devon Quinn, is the man who broke her heart five years ago. But thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no way Eve can turn down the assignment. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the big break their fledgling company needs.\nTo boost ArsenalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s social media presence the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s manager wants intimate coverage, especially of Devon, which means traveling with the band in their tour bus while they promote their new album. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not long before Devon tries to rehash the past but Eve would rather leave it buried where it is.\nWhen Eve is asked to be part of a music video, she decides itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a great opportunity to reap some revenge by showing Devon what heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s missing. But soon sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the one losing control.
