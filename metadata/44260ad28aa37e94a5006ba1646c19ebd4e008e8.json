But what does the brain have to say about the way we carry our hearts? In the wake of a divorce, science writer and single mother Kayt Sukel made herself a guinea pig in the labs of some unusual love experts to find out. This Is Your Brain on Sex is her lively and hilarious examination of the big questions about love and sex, previously published in hardcover as Dirty Minds.\n\nEach chapter of this edgy romp through the romantic brain looks at a different aspect of love above the belt. What in your brain makes you love someoneÃ¢â‚¬â€or simply lust after them? Why do good girls like bad boys? Is monogamy practical? How thin is that line between love and hate? After reading this gimlet-eyed look at love, sex, and the brain, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll never look at romance the same way again","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44260ad28aa37e94a5006ba1646c19ebd4e008e8","amp;dn":"This+Is+Your+Brain+On+Sex+-+Kayt+Sukel","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44260ad28aa37e94a5006ba1646c19ebd4e008e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,38,10,210,138,163,126,148,165,0,107,161,100,108,25,235,212,224,8,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
