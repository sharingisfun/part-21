The idea was that the New Seekers\nwould appeal to the same market as the original Seekers, but their music had\nrock as well as folk influences. They achieved worldwide success in the early\n1970s. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Seekers#Discography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Seekers#Discography&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nWith art work\n\nThe New Seekers  -  The Singles\n2003\n\n01  The New Seekers - The Singles - Meet My Lord\n02  The New Seekers - The Singles - What Have They Done To My Song Ma?\n03  The New Seekers - The Singles - When There's No Love Left\n04  The New Seekers - The Singles - Beautiful People\n05  The New Seekers - The Singles - Nickel Song\n06  The New Seekers - The Singles - Never Ending Song Of Love\n07  The New Seekers - The Singles - Good Old-Fashioned Music\n08  The New Seekers - The Singles - Tonight\n09  The New Seekers - The Singles - I'd Like To Teach The World To Sing\n10  The New Seekers - The Singles - Beg, Steal Or Borrow\n11  The New Seekers - The Singles - Circles\n12  The New Seekers - The Singles - For You We Sing\n13  The New Seekers - The Singles - Dance, Dance, Dance\n14  The New Seekers - The Singles - Come Softly To Me\n15  The New Seekers - The Singles - Pinball Wizard/See Me Feel Me\n16  The New Seekers - The Singles - Nevertheless (I'm In Love With You)\n17  The New Seekers - The Singles - Goodbye Is Just Another Word\n18  The New Seekers - The Singles - We've Got To Do It Now\n19  The New Seekers - The Singles - You Won't Find Another Fool Like Me\n20  The New Seekers - The Singles - Song For You And Me\n21  The New Seekers - The Singles - I Get A Little Sentimental Over You\n22  The New Seekers - The Singles - Sing Hallelujah\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/singles-mw0000468208&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/singles-mw0000468208&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:889f3994dbe89f621963c15c65aed2f6989d801b","amp;dn":"The+New+Seekers+-+The+Singles+%5B2003%5D++FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"889f3994dbe89f621963c15c65aed2f6989d801b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,159,57,148,219,232,159,98,25,99,193,92,101,174,210,246,152,157,128,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
