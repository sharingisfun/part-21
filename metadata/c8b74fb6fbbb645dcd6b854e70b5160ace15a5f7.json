The present collection explores this debate at an \n   important crossroads, echoing Karl Polanyi's famous observation in 1944 of \n   the disembeddedness of the market from society. Drawing on pertinent \n   insights from scholars, practitioners and regulators in corporate and labor \n   law, securities regulation as well as economic sociology and management\n   theory, the contributions shed important light on the empirical effects on \n   the economy of the shift to shareholder primacy, in light of a comprehensive \n   reconsideration of the global context, policy goals and regulatory forms  \n   which characterize market governance today.\n\n   &lt;--( Contact Us )-----------------------------------------------------------&gt;\n\n\n          &gt;&gt;&gt; Not a Chance, Msg up eMAG They Take Fools Like You. ;) &lt;&lt;&lt;\n\n                &gt;&gt;&gt; Closed Group, We Dont Need Anything Thanks &lt;&lt;&lt;\n\n   &lt;--( Legal Info )-----------------------------------------------------------&gt;\n\n     We Provide These Books On a Try Before Buy Basis, Please if You Use The\n     Books You Like, Support The Publishers/Authors And Youl Have Good Karma!\n\n     What We Dont Do is Provide These Books For You To Spread On Your Faggy\n     Filesharing Networks, To Tom, Dick &amp; Harry.
