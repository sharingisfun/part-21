Thompson, who worked tirelessly to keep the great man from harm for nearly 18 years. Shaping a massive amount of archival footage into a narrative at once historically familiar but freshly energized by an emphasis on Thompson's point-of-view, Churchill's Bodyguard is historical suspense. The 13-part series begins with a 1911 incident in which the 35-year-old, then-Home Secretary Churchill led police on an effort to apprehend anarchists who robbed a bank. Watching from the London crowd, Thompson witnessed a bullet barely miss the future prime minister. In a few years, Thomspon would be in proximity to Churchill again, this time guarding him from IRA assassination threats.\n\nPart of the story in Churchill's Bodyguard is the stark contrast between the two men. Thompson was the son of an insurance salesman; Churchill enjoyed many advantages in his wealthy family. Yet if Churchill was one of the key figures keeping the civilized world intact against the Axis threat during World War II, Thompson, a Scotland Yard detective, kept him on his rendezvous with destiny. Among the amazing stories are numerous attempts on Churchill's life from the likes of Irish terrorists, Indian assassins, Hitler's hit men and Luftwaffe fighters and U Boats, V2 rockets striking London, hidden explosives, and random crazed gunmen. But the intrepid Churchill marched on, even surviving pneumonia (with Thompson at his side) and doubts about crucial allies Roosevelt and Stalin. The intrigue surrounding Churchill's conferences with his American and Russian counterparts in Tehran and elsewhere is all here, as are remarkable encounters with Lawrence of Arabia and Dwight Eisenhower. --Tom Keogh\n\nProduct Description\nWalter H. Thompson appears at Winston ChurchillÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s side in nearly every wartime newsreelÃ¢â‚¬â€tall, gaunt, and always hawk-eyed. As the great manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s personal bodyguard for nearly 18 years, Thompson saw history unfold firsthand. At times, his vigilance and quick thinking helped shape it.\n\nBased on the complete, uncensored manuscript of ThompsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s memoirsÃ¢â‚¬â€uncovered only after his deathÃ¢â‚¬â€this 13-part documentary gives you a behind-the-scenes look at ChurchillÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life and leadership. Thompson shadows his boss everywhere, from Cairo to Yalta to the Western front. With his eye for character-revealing detail, he takes the measure of T.E. Lawrence, Adolf Hitler, Franklin Roosevelt, and Joseph StalinÃ¢â‚¬â€not only as leaders, but also as men. And he vividly recounts attempts on ChurchillÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life by Nazi commandos, IRA terrorists, and other would-be assassins, some never before disclosed.\n\nUsing archival newsreel footage, historically precise reenactments, and ThompsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own words, ChurchillÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Bodyguard puts you inside the skin of a working-class Scotland Yard detective who experienced the 20th-centuryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s great events as both witness and participant.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b7bb2014767411f722d90a0c67822dd58bf6ad8","amp;dn":"Churchill%27s+Bodyguard+%282005%29+.x264+%5BBBC+Docu%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b7bb2014767411f722d90a0c67822dd58bf6ad8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,123,178,1,71,103,65,31,114,45,144,160,198,120,34,221,88,191,106,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
