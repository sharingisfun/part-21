The first two dealt with a doctor and patient, while the remaining three issues covered a group of goth kids. The first two issues rapidly sold out and required a second printing, in fact ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSilent Hill #2 sold out, including IDWÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s overprinting, before it even shipped to stores.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nIn the first two chapters, Dr. Troy Abernathy wants to cure Lynn DeAngelis from her delusions, which began after she went to do a movie in the town of Silent Hill. Abernathy takes her back to the townÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ only to discover a world built from his inner fears, and ruled by a demonic little girl ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Christabella ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ who seeks guilty souls. From Chapter 3 until the conclusion, a goth girl named Lauryn finds LynnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s movie and plans to go to Silent Hill to do the same stunt so her group can earn some cash. There, a final confrontation with Christabella occurs, when Lauryn realizes Christabella is a tad more familiar than she would have thought in the first place.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAmong the DamnedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ was a stand-alone one-shot story published in 2004 with art by Shaun Thomas. It is collected in the Silent Hill: Three Bloody Tales trade paperback.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPaint It BlackÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ was another one-shot with art by Shaun Thomas from 2005, also collected in Three Bloody Tales.\n\nIt follows the story of Ike, an artist who finds himself homeless after being kicked out of a friendÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s apartment. Ike remains under the influence of ArtistÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Block until he meets a stranger who claims to have visited the ghost town of Silent Hill. The stranger informs Ike that he was able to leave the town because his own friend sacrificed himself, this story inspires Ike to travel to the town to seek out the truth behind it.\n\nInspired, Ike is able to paint again; however his portraits now feature the creatures that live in the town, and he has found that he is unable to leave. The story then takes an unusual turn as a team of cheerleaders arrive in Silent Hill looking for some friends who they believe went missing in the town.\n\nAs the plot continues to follow a strange set of developments, Ike discovers that he can actually travel through his paintings and he attempts to use them to escape.\n\nHis escape attempt fails and he finds that the cheerleaders have turned on him, sacrificing him so they can leave town.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Grinning ManÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (2005) is the third one-shot collected in Three Bloody Tales with art by Nick Stakal.\n\nState Trooper Robert Tower is on his last day of work before retirement when his new replacement, Mayberry, arrives. Despite the fact that Tower enters Silent Hill on a regular basis to look for missing people, heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s never been exposed to the horrifying creatures that roam its streets. However, to play a prank on Mayberry (a firm believer in not only the lore of Silent Hill, but also several other conspiracy theories and supernatural concepts), he stages a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMonsterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ attack with two other officers. However, there is a new force in the town of Silent Hill ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a smiling madman with a mastery of both magical spells and firearms who considers the city his own personal hunting ground. The truth about the city is exposed to Tower and the showdown between he and the mysterious Grinning Man ensues. This story is collected in the Silent Hill: Three Bloody Tales trade paperback.\n\nSilent Hill &quot;Among the damned&quot; \n            &quot;Dying Inside 1-5&quot; \n            &quot;Paint it black&quot; \n            &quot;SinnerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s reward 1-4&quot; \n            &quot;Grinning man&quot;\n\nCbr files can be opened with &quot;Winrar&quot;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a7da42cd68345d0e214741659f0fef688f80db9","amp;dn":"Silent+Hill+Comic+series+%2812+issues%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a7da42cd68345d0e214741659f0fef688f80db9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,125,164,44,214,131,69,208,226,20,116,22,89,240,254,246,136,248,13,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
