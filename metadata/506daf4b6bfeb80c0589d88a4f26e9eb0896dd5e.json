The film was nominated for the Academy Award for best foreign film?actually won that year by Ji?ÃƒÂ­ Menzel&amp;#039;s Ost?e sledovanÃƒÂ© vlaky (Closely Observed Trains)?and the same year it won the Special Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival. The following year it was nominated for a Golden Globe.\n\nMature master\n\nEven before he achieved international success, Petrovi? was already considered to be one of the pre-eminent directors in Yugoslavia and was recognised as one of the founders of and a leading light in the Novi Film (New Film) movement that dominated Yugoslav cinema in the 1960s. His 1961 film Dvoje (Two) had paved the way for Novi Film, while Tri (Three, 1965) was widely seen as one of the most mature and accomplished films of the whole movement.\n\nIn fact, Petrovi? was one of three directors who effectively dominated Novi Film tendencies throughout the 1960s, the others being ?ivojin Pavlovi? and the much more well-known Du?an Makavejev, later to achieve international fame and some measure of lasting notoriety with his film WR: Mysteries of the Organism (1970).\n\nThe Novi Film movement did not have a specific program but can perhaps best be seen as one aspect of the major changes taking place in Yugoslav society during the 1960s. As society moved towards a greater level of democratisation and decentralisation, filmmakers too began to demand the right to greater individual artistic expression and more freedom from bureaucratic control.\n\nThey also wanted more leeway for experimentation with the form of film and in particular they wanted to be able to address the more negative aspects of their society and of human existence in general. Nevertheless, these goals were still to be realised within the context of a Socialist state, and not in opposition to it. One might look at this as an early expression of the famous &quot;Socialism with a human face&quot; that the Czechs were to make their own in 1968.\n\n\nsize: 733,419,520 bytes\nlength: 1:22:03\nresolution: 640 x 400\nMD5 hash: BBA647907D0472B3D0D30858D9B02BBD\nvideo codec: XviD0047 1060kbps 25fps 12bit PB-NVOP PVOP BVOP ESSc\naudio codec: MP3 LAME3.97 48kHz 118kbps VBR stereo","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:506daf4b6bfeb80c0589d88a4f26e9eb0896dd5e","amp;dn":"Skupljaci-perja.XviD-mp3.YUF-KG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"506daf4b6bfeb80c0589d88a4f26e9eb0896dd5e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,109,175,75,107,254,184,12,5,137,216,138,79,38,233,235,8,150,221,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
