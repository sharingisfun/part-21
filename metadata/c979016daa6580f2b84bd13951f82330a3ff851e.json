Since the age of Shakespeare, arguments over correct usage have been acrimonious, and those involved have always really been contesting values - to do with morality, politics and class. \nTHE LANGUAGE WARS examines the present state of the conflict, its history and its future. \nAbove all, it uses the past as a way of illuminating the present. Moving chronologically, \nthe book explores the most persistent issues to do with English and unpacks the history of 'proper' usage. \nWhere did these ideas spring from? Which of today's bugbears and annoyances are actually venerable? Who has been on the front line in the language wars? \nTHE LANGUAGE WARS examines grammar rules, regional accents, swearing, spelling, dictionaries, political correctness, and \nthe role of electronic media in reshaping language. It also takes a look at such niggling concerns as the split infinitive, elocution and text messaging. \nPeopled with intriguing characters such as Jonathan Swift, H. W. Fowler and George Orwell as well as the more disparate figures of Lewis Carroll, \nBuffy the Vampire Slayer and Lenny Bruce, THE LANGUAGE WARS is an essential volume for anyone interested in the state of the English language today or intrigued about its future.\n\nPLZ SEED WHILE AND AFTER DOWNLOADING...\n\n&quot;SHARING IS CARING&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c979016daa6580f2b84bd13951f82330a3ff851e","amp;dn":"The+Language+Wars-+A+History+of+Proper+English%5BTeam+Nanban%5D%5BTPB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c979016daa6580f2b84bd13951f82330a3ff851e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,121,1,109,170,101,128,242,184,75,209,57,81,248,35,48,163,255,133,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
