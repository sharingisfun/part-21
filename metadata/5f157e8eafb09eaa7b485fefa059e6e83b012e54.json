Now heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s facing five years of servitude to a conceited director named Raoul St. Cyr, whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s taken a thoughtful play about Portuguese fishermen and added dancing mermaids. When it seems the plot has changed to include a robot from the future Nicholas looses all hope, but this robot may be just what he needs to win his freedom. Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Ego Machine was first published in the May, 1952 issue of Space Science Fiction magazine.\n\nFrom: BitTorrentScene [BTScene]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f157e8eafb09eaa7b485fefa059e6e83b012e54","amp;dn":"The+Ego+Machine+by+Henry+Kuttner+%5BrepublicV%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f157e8eafb09eaa7b485fefa059e6e83b012e54","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,21,126,142,175,176,158,170,123,72,95,239,160,89,230,232,59,1,46,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
