The macabre and the bloodcurdling, the funny and the sad, distilled from myth, world cultures, religion, literature, science, medicine and contemporary life; when it comes to the penis everyoneâ€™s a critic. â€œWhen the prick stands up, the brains get buried in the ground.â€ â€“Yiddish Proverb\n\nThroughout history, man has revered his penis as his â€œmost precious ornament.â€ From small to large, thick to thin, smooth to wrinkled, Hickman lets the history of this mystery hangout for all to see. It is a stiff subject, but we easily settle in with the likes of Bill Clinton, Michelangeloâ€™s David, and Shakespeare as they followed their heads. With precious detail given to precious material, if you were to wrap your hands around anything less than two-inches, it should be Godâ€™s Doodle, a brilliant history of the penis that hits the topic right on the head. It reaches through time and looks at how the penis trended long before one was ever posted on Twitter.\n\nYou will be impotent with both laughter and information as you read â€œâ€™â€¦subtly, unhurriedly and mercilesslyâ€™ (Alex Comfort The Joy of Sex),â€ as Hickman discusses ancient literatures and mathematical quandaries of possible positions, such as Greeceâ€™s â€œthe lion on the cheese-grater,â€ which still keeps scholars from being cocksure about the potential.\n\nPlease seed back and share with others. :)\n\nFor moar penis, see the forum's world-famous penis thread: https://pirates-forum.org/Thread-penis--32416\n\nalso, penis :D\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a11947ff336e265d0521e06d9486ac437f232d9e","amp;dn":"God%27s+Doodle%3A+The+Life+and+Times+of+the+Penis","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a11947ff336e265d0521e06d9486ac437f232d9e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,25,71,255,51,110,38,93,5,33,224,109,148,134,172,67,127,35,45,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
