It's about the apostle John who, as an old man, is exiled to the island of Patmos, where he's forced into slave labor and he and the other Christians are persecuted for their beliefs. He also gets divine inspiration to write the Book of Revelation, and the movie then enacts the apocalypse, horsemen and all. \n\nThis was produced by something called &quot;Evangelical Outreach&quot; and Christian filmmaker Ken Anderson and filmed in a quarry in Northern Ireland. I ripped it just for you. Comments are welcome.\n\n\nWritten and directed by Jimmy Murphy. Starring Louis Rolston, Mark Mulholland, Joe McPartland, John Hewit, Bob Quinn, Liam O'Callaghan\n\n\n\nAVI File Details\n========================================\nFile Name .......................................: Patmos 1985.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 939,710,464 bytes\nRuntime .........................................: 1:12:05\n\nVideo Info\nVideo Codec .....................................: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size ......................................: 704x528 (AR: 1.333)\nFPS .............................................: 23.976\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1592 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ..................................: 0.179 bpp\nCompatibillity...................................: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Info\nAudio Codec .....................................: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate .....................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 133 kb/s [2 channel(s)] VBR\nNo. of audio streams ............................: 1 ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bbf12cd5c864310736b5b4931f0c43e219de65cb","amp;dn":"Patmos+%281985%29+%28christian+movie%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bbf12cd5c864310736b5b4931f0c43e219de65cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,241,44,213,200,100,49,7,54,181,180,147,31,12,67,226,25,222,101,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
