This work, written by Gaelic historian Fergus Cannan, looks at the clan and family structures of the galloglass, their performance in battle, their weapons and armour, and way of life in time of peace and war. The unique fighting skills and tactics of the galloglass are also examined in this pioneering study, as well as how galloglass were organized on the battlefield, and their command structures and systems of rank","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca6d09d45d75c68e4a9f067cefd135ba690d174e","amp;dn":"Galloglass+1250-1600%3A+Gaelic+Mercenary+Warrior","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca6d09d45d75c68e4a9f067cefd135ba690d174e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,109,9,212,93,117,198,142,74,159,6,124,239,209,53,186,105,13,23,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
