Length 220 km.\n\nAs far as I know it took place on October 15, 1999.\n\nThis and my other torrents were broadcasted as a filling programme which \nruns at night in the 1st German television (ARD) and are emitted after the end\nand before the beginning of the regular programme as long as needed. \nTherefore, the broadcasting appointments are very unreliable and seldom \nto predict correct.\n\nI catch as many parts as possible using Windows Media Center recording in \nits special format .wtv and convert it with Windowds 7 own possibility to a\ndvr-ms file. Then I cut and merge the parts with &quot;DVR-MS Editor&quot; 1.2.\nAfterwards the file is converted with PowerDirector 8 to mpg since I think,\nit is the most popular format everybody can handle.\n\nHope, you enjoy my CabRide-torrents and share it to others.\nPlease keep seeding.\n\n*******************************************************************************","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d40f224b684ce501819273c8a6ddfbde12214dcf","amp;dn":"Trains.Germany.Linda.Munich.1999.CabRide.dTV.SVCD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d40f224b684ce501819273c8a6ddfbde12214dcf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,15,34,75,104,76,229,1,129,146,115,200,166,221,251,222,18,33,77,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
