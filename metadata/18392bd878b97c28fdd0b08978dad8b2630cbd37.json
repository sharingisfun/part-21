The recording by Bing Crosby shot to the top ten of the record charts that year and became a holiday musical tradition in the United States. The idea of being home for Christmas originated in World War I when soldiers at first thought that the war would be quick and they would return by Christmastime. This inevitably did not happen, hence the line &quot;if only in my dreams&quot;.\n\nA song titled &quot;I'll Be Home for Christmas&quot; was first copyrighted on August 24, 1943, by Kent (music) and James &quot;Kim&quot; Gannon (lyrics). The two revised and re-copyrighted their song on September 27, 1943, and it was this version that was made famous by Crosby. The label on Crosby's recording credits &quot;I'll Be Home for Christmas&quot; to Kent, Gannon, and Ram. Later recordings usually credit only Kent and Gannon. The discrepancy arose from the fact that on December 21, 1942 Buck Ram copyrighted a song titled &quot;I'll Be Home for Christmas (Tho' Just in Memory)&quot;ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½that song bore little or no resemblance, other than its title, to the Crosby recording.\n\nRascal Flatts released their first Greatest Hits CD, Greatest Hits Volume 1 on October 28, 2008. The album contains 13 of their biggest songs, starting with &quot;Prayin' for Daylight&quot; and going through &quot;Life Is a Highway&quot;. The limited edition of the album contains a second disc with three Christmas songs: &quot;White Christmas&quot;, &quot;Jingle Bell Rock&quot;, and &quot;I'll Be Home for Christmas&quot;.\n\nRascal Flatts released the first single &quot;Here Comes Goodbye&quot; from their album, Unstoppable, to radio on January 20, and the album was released on April 7, 2009. The song was co-written by American Idol season 6 finalist Chris Sligh. The second single, &quot;Summer Nights&quot;, co-written by Gary LeVox, was released in early May 2009 debuting at #57 and topped out at #2 on the country charts. The group performed Summer Nights at the &quot;CMT Music Awards&quot;, Oprah's Kickoff Party, and the finale of &quot;America's Got Talent&quot;. The third single off the album, &quot;Why&quot;, currently stands at #18 on the country charts. The 'Flatts performed Why on &quot;The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien&quot;.\n\nA special release version of their album, Unstoppable, is available at JCPenney stores nationwide. It features a special release song entitled &quot;American Living&quot; only available on the albums sold at JCPenney stores. JCPenney is an official sponsor of Rascal Flatts' Unstoppable American Living Tour in an two-year partnership and $1 of every CD sold at JCPenney will be donated to the JCPenney Afterschool Fund.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18392bd878b97c28fdd0b08978dad8b2630cbd37","amp;dn":"Rascal+Flatts+-+I%5C%27ll+Be+Home+For+Christmas++%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18392bd878b97c28fdd0b08978dad8b2630cbd37","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,57,43,216,120,185,124,40,253,208,176,137,120,218,216,178,99,12,189,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
