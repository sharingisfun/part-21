Chaos reigns in the capital, and no one can stop the necromancer but Rhiannon and her winged mare. But can she bring herself to rescue the woman she hates more than anyone-Olywynne, her rival for the apprentice-witch Lewen's love-especially when she stands to lose everything she holds dear in the effort?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81c3fe771c0e4fc5b0cdf91b99e26218c9254328","amp;dn":"The+Heart+of+Stars+-+Kate+Forsyth","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81c3fe771c0e4fc5b0cdf91b99e26218c9254328","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,195,254,119,28,14,79,197,176,205,249,27,153,226,98,24,201,37,67,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
