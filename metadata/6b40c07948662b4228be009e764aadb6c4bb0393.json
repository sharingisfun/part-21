Its unexpectedly gritty, soulful production makes it something of a spiritual twin to Dusty Springfield's Dusty in Memphis, also released in 1969 (both even feature renditions of &quot;Son of a Preacher Man&quot;): Gentry's husky, sensual delivery proves as ideally suited for the Southern-fried funk of the opening title track as it does for the bluegrass-flavored &quot;Natural to Be Gone,&quot; deftly moving from genre to genre to encompass everything from faux-gospel (&quot;Glory Hallelujah, How They'll Sing&quot;) to lushly orchestrated pop (&quot;I Wouldn't Be Surprised,&quot; the disc's centerpiece). Even more eye-opening is that Gentry's originals stand tall alongside material from composers including Burt Bacharach (&quot;I'll Never Fall in Love Again,&quot; which earned her a chart-topping single in the U.K.) and Jimmy Webb (&quot;Where's the Playground, Johnny&quot;) -- her folky &quot;Seasons Come, Seasons Go,&quot; an acute tale of lost love, offers Touch 'Em With Love's most profoundly beautiful moment. A truly great and tragically under-recognized album.\n-Allmusic","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b40c07948662b4228be009e764aadb6c4bb0393","amp;dn":"Bobbie+Gentry+-+Touch+%27Em+With+Love+%5B1969%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b40c07948662b4228be009e764aadb6c4bb0393","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,64,192,121,72,102,43,66,40,190,0,158,118,74,173,182,196,187,3,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
