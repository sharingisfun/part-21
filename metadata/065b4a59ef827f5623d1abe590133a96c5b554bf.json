Searchable pdf (clearscan) with contents in bookmarks, accurate pagination and metadata, etc.\n\n\nI scanned this one awhile back but never got around to uploading it. I just found out he died on September 5 -- two days ago -- as I was preparing this upload. Now I'm shocked.\n\nThis is a hard book to describe, but Capon was a fine writer. I think I started reading him years ago after a recommendation from Peter Kreeft. (He's a better writer than Kreeft.) Here's a quote from the blurb on the back cover: &quot;Pastoral theology has seldom spoken to the modern world with such wonder, wisdom and historic immediacy as is shown in this eminently sane and provocative book.&quot; (from America, the Jesuit publication)\n\nwikipedia says this about Capon:\n\nRobert Farrar Capon (1925-2013) was an American Episcopal priest and author. A lifelong New Yorker, for almost thirty years Capon was a full-time parish priest in Port Jefferson, New York. In 1965, he published his first book, Bed and Board, and in 1977 he left the full-time ministry to devote more time to his writing career. He authored a total of twenty books, including Between Noon and Three, The Supper of the Lamb, Genesis: The Movie, and a trilogy on JesusÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ parables: The Parables of Grace, The Parables of the Kingdom, and The Parables of Judgment.\n\nCapon described himself in the introduction to one of his books as an &quot;old-fashioned high churchman and a Thomist to boot.&quot; One of Capon's primary themes is the radical grace of God. Capon summarizes his broad view of salvation as follows:\n\n&quot;I am and I am not a universalist. I am one if you are talking about what God in Christ has done to save the world. The Lamb of God has not taken away the sins of some Ã¢â‚¬â€ of only the good, or the cooperative, or the select few who can manage to get their act together and die as perfect peaches. He has taken away the sins of the world Ã¢â‚¬â€ of every last being in it - and he has dropped them down the black hole of Jesus' death. On the cross, he has shut up forever on the subject of guilt: 'There is therefore now no condemnation. . . .' All human beings, at all times and places, are home free whether they know it or not, feel it or not, believe it or not.\n\n&quot;But I am not a universalist if you are talking about what people may do about accepting that happy-go-lucky gift of God's grace. I take with utter seriousness everything that Jesus had to say about hell, including the eternal torment that such a foolish non-acceptance of his already-given acceptance must entail. All theologians who hold Scripture to be the Word of God must inevitably include in their work a tractate on hell. But I will not - because Jesus did not - locate hell outside the realm of grace. Grace is forever sovereign, even in Jesus' parables of judgment. No one is ever kicked out at the end of those parables who wasn't included in at the beginning.&quot;\n\n--------------\n\nIf anyone has other Capon books, please share!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:065b4a59ef827f5623d1abe590133a96c5b554bf","amp;dn":"Robert+Farrar+Capon+-+An+Offering+of+Uncles+%28pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"065b4a59ef827f5623d1abe590133a96c5b554bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,91,74,89,239,130,127,86,35,209,171,229,144,19,58,150,197,181,84,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
