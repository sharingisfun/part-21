Discover dreams and nightmares filled with puzzles and secrets to help Howard find the meaning to his life.\n\nDreamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gameplay is strongly based around exploration with games such as Yume Nikki and LSD being the initial inspiration for the concept. On top of this we have been inspired by the narrative elements in Dear Esther and Deus ExÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s non-linear story telling and environments, the resulting gameplay maintains aspects of all 4 games. There will be many puzzles to solve, horror sections and some more narrative focused areas. So we hope it will have a range of elements for everyone to enjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e561726240a8047aae48c166107ac3854fd6702b","amp;dn":"Dream+Pre-Alpha+v2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e561726240a8047aae48c166107ac3854fd6702b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,97,114,98,64,168,4,122,174,72,193,102,16,122,195,133,79,214,112,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
