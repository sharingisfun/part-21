After all, we're all victims of heartache and strife at some point. Maybe I'm a little more susceptible to both, but I've got an ace up my sleeve. I've got Ty McCabe. He's helped me survive a lot. More than I ever thought possible. We've come a long way together, but we can't stop now. What's that old saying? Don't rest on your laurels? Well, I'm not resting and neither is he. Life didn't even give us that option. We've got problems. Big ones. Let's see if we can do this, survive the downs and get back to the ups. Guess only time will tell.\n\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0255937646fdfba43e5b33a374d41849c3dacaa6","amp;dn":"Never+Can+Tell+%28Never+Too+Late+%231%29+by+C.M.+Stunich+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0255937646fdfba43e5b33a374d41849c3dacaa6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,85,147,118,70,253,251,164,62,91,51,163,116,212,24,73,195,218,202,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
