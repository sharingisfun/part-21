Richelson walks us down the corridors of CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, and through the four decades of science, scientists, and managers that produced the CIA we have today.\n\nHe tells a story of amazing technological innovation in service of intelligence gathering, of bitter bureaucratic infighting, and sometimes, as in the case of its Ã¢â‚¬Å“mind-controlÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ adventure, of stunning moral failure. Based on original interviews and extensive archival research, The Wizards of Langley turns a piercing lamp on many of the agencyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s activities, many never before made public.\n\nMeet the Author:\n\nJeffrey T. Richelson received his PhD in political science from the University of Rochester and has taught at The University of Texas at Austin and American University, Washington, DC. A senior fellow at the National Security Archive in Washington, DC, Richelson has authored numerous works on intelligence, including A Century of Spies, The Wizards of Langley, and Spying on the Bomb.\n\nGenre: Non-Fiction / US Goverment / Spying","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3212e3eeb3654725f0bc35de0bebb8129272f925","amp;dn":"Wizards+Of+Langley+by+Jeffrey+Richelson","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3212e3eeb3654725f0bc35de0bebb8129272f925","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,18,227,238,179,101,71,37,240,188,53,222,11,235,184,18,146,114,249,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
