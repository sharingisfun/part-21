Why? Because this little book aimed to educate teenagers about democracy, sex and drugs - in frank, simple language - and encouraged them to view adults as &quot;paper tigers&quot;. The Little Red Schoolbook has been unavailable for more than 40 years, but it remains surprisingly relevant for young people today. Reissued here in its original and uncensored format, with informative footnotes and a new foreword by the surviving author Soren Hansen, it encourages teenagers to have the confidence to seek information for themselves, challenge authority and question the status quo.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:94474783bf0840094a847fb98820b5dbadb85fbe","amp;dn":"The+Little+Red+Schoolbook+%282014%29+epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"94474783bf0840094a847fb98820b5dbadb85fbe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,71,71,131,191,8,64,9,74,132,127,185,136,32,181,219,173,184,95,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
