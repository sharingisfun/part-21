It&amp;#039;s 1971 and publisher Glenn Howard (Gene Barry) is driving along a mountain road while dictating a letter to the president about environmental issues, when he suddenly blacks out. He is picked up by a rescue team wearing breathing masks and taken to a world beneath the Earth&amp;#039;s surface, circa 2017. The powers-that-be in this subterranean world refuse to answer Howard&amp;#039;s many questions as to what has happened on the surface. One thing that stood out for me and intensified the surreal atmosphere, was how the people used numbers in their conversation, much as we use acronyms, which is fine IF you know what they represent.\n\nStars Gene Barry as Glenn Howard\nGuest star: Sharon Farrell (Sandrelle), Severn Darden (Cameron), Paul Stewart (Dr. Rubas), Regis Cordic (Chairman), Louise Latham (Helen), Geoffrey Lewis (Bates), Jason Wingreen (Hammond), Michael C.
