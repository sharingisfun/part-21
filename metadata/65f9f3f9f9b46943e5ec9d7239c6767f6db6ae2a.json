Recorded live at La Ve Lee (a small club near Los Angeles), the extended program has Henderson mostly in the spotlight with electric bassist John Humphrey offering strong support and drummer Kirk Covington sometimes contributing rockish vocals that are as much shouting as they are singing. Henderson plays some jazz on Wayne Shorter&amp;#039;s &quot;Fee Fi Fo Fum,&quot; digs into blues now and then, and displays some country roots on &quot;Hillbilly in the Band&quot; but mostly plays high-intensity fusion, tearing into the pieces and showing that he could hold his own with any rock/fusion guitarist. Invigorating playing. \n\n\nTo check out all TQMP uploads:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/breezin/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/breezin/&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/slavetothesound/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/slavetothesound/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/downup/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/downup/&lt;/a&gt;\nOr use the TQMP searchtag.\n\nPlease feel free to join TQMP!\nThe &quot;rules&quot; are simple: Rip your CD (no 1980&amp;#039;s cassettetapes or vinylrips please!) in lossless format (flac is preferable) AND include artwork. Include the TQMP searchtag in your title, so it can easily be found. (Yes, on Google as well..)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:65f9f3f9f9b46943e5ec9d7239c6767f6db6ae2a","amp;dn":"Scott+Henderson+-+2005+-+Live+TQMP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"65f9f3f9f9b46943e5ec9d7239c6767f6db6ae2a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,249,243,249,249,180,105,67,229,236,157,114,57,198,118,127,109,182,174,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
