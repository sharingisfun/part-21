They flee the carnage, sharing a stagecoach with an aristocratic family, a shopkeeper and his wife.  The bourgeois donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t hesitate to express their prejudice, but the prostitutes show themselves to be of greater moral fiber.  The mother of the family tries to steal their food.  Okin catches her and, being proud, takes it back and refuses the attempted payment for it, but Oyuki later offers it to the others generously.  Later incidents again show the differing attitudes of the two, but in each case they prove that the Ã¢â‚¬Å“lowerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ classes can be made of finer stuff (both in terms of survival and basic human decency) than the eliteÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ and always end up with the short end of the stick regardless.  Of course, being Mizoguchi, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hardly surprising to see a sympathetic portrayal of hookers, and he handles it with his usual sensitivity and a fair bit of nuance.  The film doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t flow that smoothly Ã¢â‚¬â€ in one part thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s such a leap that I wondered if footage was missing Ã¢â‚¬â€ but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an interesting tale with some nice touches.  The religious angle adds something different.  The filmÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Japanese title is Maria no Oyuki, and sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also directly compared to Jesus.  Not a whole lot is ultimately made of this, and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s kind of a ham-fisted slant, but it is different.\n\nRip Specs (DVD Rip)\n\nGeneral           : Maria no Oyuki.mkv\nFormat            : Matroska at 2 456 Kbps\nLength            : 1.30 GiB for 1h 15mn 46s 40ms\n\nVideo #0          : AVC at 1 999 Kbps\nAspect            : 720 x 576 (1.333) at 25.000 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AC-3 at 448 Kbps\nInfos             : 1 channel, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage          : ja\n\nText #0           : VobSub\nLanguage          : en\n\nText #1           : VobSub\nLanguage          : fr\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0026682/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0026682/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAudio: Japanese\nSubtitles: English, French\n\nMy rip.\n\nMaria no Oyuki AKA Oyuki, the Virgin (Mizoguchi, 1935)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb9b94b4221d6ee175bc89afc9ecfefc9b80bc1c","amp;dn":"Maria+no+Oyuki+AKA+Oyuki%2C+the+Virgin+%28Mizoguchi%2C+1935%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb9b94b4221d6ee175bc89afc9ecfefc9b80bc1c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,155,148,180,34,29,110,225,117,188,137,175,201,236,254,252,155,128,188,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
