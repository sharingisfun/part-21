Indeed, this new double set is actually his fourth live collection, though entirely different in mood and approach to 1994Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s often raucous Live at The Point. That Dublin venue might be the same as that utilised for this new live set, but one major difference is that this is no solo outing since MooreÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s old mucker from Moving Hearts Declan Sinnott is also present, providing an assortment of electric and acoustic guitars and even getting his own vocal spot on Corinna Corinna. The albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s thirty-two tracks stretch across the forty years of ChristyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s career and, as he notes himself, Ã¢â‚¬Ëœsome were well rehearsed while others were more of the momentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. Confidence oozes from MooreÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pores and Sinnott provides a more than capable foil, but (apart from the latterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s guitarwork) thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s little new here. The abiding sensation is of a powerful singer able to draw from a phenomenally extensive back catalogue and retain the ability to explore a songÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lyrics no matter how many times heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sung it before (and aficionados of Moore will already possess most of the songs performed here). The mood is generally relaxed, though Christy certainly lets rip on Ã¢â‚¬ËœFaithful DepartedÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. As ever, the manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a master at dealing with hecklers Ã¢â‚¬â€œ when someone calls for Ã¢â‚¬ËœNancy WhiskeyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ he retorts Ã¢â‚¬ËœYou probably havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t noticed, but weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got another one startedÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. Overall, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a grand souvenir for anyone lucky enough to witness recent concerts, and if you werenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t there, the same titled DVD (Columbia 828768 27789) will show you what you were missing (though donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t expect much excitement from the sight of two middle-aged musicians remaining seated throughout the gig). If you want to hear Moore in all his pomp and prime head for Live at The Point instead..\n\nCD-01 - Track Listings\n\n[01] Two Island Swans\n[02] North &amp; South\n[03] So Do I\n[04] Hattie Carroll\n[05] Motherland\n[06] Wise &amp; Holy Woman\n[07] Casey\n[08] Magdalene Laundry\n[09] Missing You\n[10] Beeswing\n[11] Smoke &amp; Strong Whiskey\n[12] America You Are Not The World\n[13] Natives\n[14] Quiet Desperation\n[15] Ordinary Man\n[16] Ride On\n[17] Vive La Quinte Brigada\n[18] The Contender\n[19] City Of Chicago\n[20] Victor Jara\n\nCD-01 Play Time - 01h:16m:54s\n\nCD-02 - Track Listings\n\n[01] The Two Conneeleys\n[02] Yellow Triangle\n[03] Strangeways\n[04] Faithfully Departed\n[05] Sacco &amp; Vanzetti\n[06] Sonny's Dream\n[07] Stitch In Time\n[08] Veronica\n[09] Corina Corina\n[10] Butterfly (So Much Wine)\n[11] Sixteen Jolly Ravers\n[12] Mercy\n[13] Cry Like A Man\n[14] Hiroshima Nagasaki Russian Roulette\n[15] Bright Blue Rose\n\nCD-02 Play Time - 00h:54m:30s\n\nTotal FLAC Play Time............. 02h:11m:26s\nTotal File Size....................... 655mb (Including FLAC + Logs, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat / Info.......................
