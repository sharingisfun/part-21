He set out on a journey that was to last three years, visiting many sections of the country and making friends of all descriptions. The Air-Conditioned Nightmare is the result of that odyssey.\n\n\nBiography\nHENRY MILLER (1891-1980) was an American writer and painter infamous for breaking with existing literary forms and developing a new sort of &quot;novel&quot; that is a mixture of novel, autobiography, social criticism, philosophical reflection, surrealist free association, and mysticism, one that is distinctly always about and expressive of the real-life Henry Miller and yet is also fictional. His most characteristic works of this kind are &quot;Tropic of Cancer,&quot; &quot;Tropic of Capricorn,&quot; and &quot;Black Spring.&quot; His books were banned in the United States for their lewd content until 1964 when a court ruling overturned this order, acknowledging Miller's work as literature in what became one of the most celebrated victories of the sexual revolution","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e2b58d2ab9d2e141293d37a8a0d598aaa389b584","amp;dn":"The+Air-Conditioned+Nightmare+-+1945-+Henry+Miller+%28292p%29+%5BInua%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e2b58d2ab9d2e141293d37a8a0d598aaa389b584","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,181,141,42,185,210,225,65,41,61,55,168,160,213,152,170,163,137,181,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
