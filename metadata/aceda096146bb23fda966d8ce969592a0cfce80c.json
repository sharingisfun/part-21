NoNextGen FANEDIT\r\n\r\nThis is a fanedit of the Star Trek Enterprise episode s4e22: These Are the Voyages... The key change with this fanedit is the removal of all images and dialog of Riker and Troi and any Next Generation set shots. For this fanedit, great effort was put into making the transitions smooth but the viewer will notice some cuts, audio fades, missing dialog, video cropping, and video cross-fades. Removing the Next Generation parts does improve the Enterprise story and lets\r\n\r\nRunning times:\r\n40m28s original, not including credits\r\n16m12s time removed, mostly Riker and Troi, some Next Gen set shots without them and a little bit of Enterprise footage with Riker in the background\r\n24m16s fanedit, not including credits\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n* Removed most of the breaks and fades for commercials except for right after Trip's death (which is strangely short at a mere 1/2 second)\r\n* Raised the volume 4db with no clipping since the source was very quiet\r\n* Moved the opening credits to the very start\r\n* Changed the opening music to the instrumental &quot;Archer's Theme&quot; instead of the original &quot;Faith of the Heart&quot; which has lyrics\r\n* Removed all images and sounds of Riker and Troi and any set shots from Next Generation; Riker is on the bridge in some scenes but you don't see his face, just his back\r\n* Completely removed every scene with Riker as Chef\r\n\r\nPlease check out other releases of Gotham, MST3K, Rifftrax, Battlestar Galactica, DC Comics, documentaries, Star Trek Enterprise and more at:\r\n  https://thepiratebay.se/user/bsg4you/  \r\n  https://kat.cr/user/bsg4you/uploads/  \r\nand leave any corrections, criticism, comments and requests.\r\n\r\nThanks, bsg4you","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aceda096146bb23fda966d8ce969592a0cfce80c","amp;dn":"Star+Trek+Enterprise+s4e22+FANEDIT+NoNextGen+720p+6ch+x265+HEVC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aceda096146bb23fda966d8ce969592a0cfce80c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,237,160,150,20,107,178,63,218,150,109,140,233,105,89,42,12,252,232,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
