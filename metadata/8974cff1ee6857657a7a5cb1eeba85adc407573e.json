For those of you looking to find something to fill those hours when C2C runs out, check out Ground Zero Radio with Clyde Lewis. I caught it by chance a few months ago just as his national syndication got started. He's syndicated by the same network as George (Premier Radio{Clear Channel}), check your local stations, it's a good compliment for the audiophiles out there. See you next week, and as always, please seed, I'm on DSL, keep this alive.....because with the other stuff I like to download.....I can't.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8974cff1ee6857657a7a5cb1eeba85adc407573e","amp;dn":"Coast+to+Coast+AM+Nov12-18th+2012","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8974cff1ee6857657a7a5cb1eeba85adc407573e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,116,207,241,238,104,87,101,122,122,92,177,238,186,133,173,196,7,87,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
