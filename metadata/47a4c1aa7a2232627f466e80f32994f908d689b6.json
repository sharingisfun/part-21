Suffering from hallucinations, he goes to Dr. Hamilton (Gary Merrill). Hamilton has invented a device that allows him to read the thoughts of another person. Hamilton and Brothers connect via the device, but then a power surge causes the unthinkable: the minds of the two men switch bodies. The deranged Maj. Brothers is bent on destroying the whole base. Unfortunately, his mind is in the psychiatrist's body, and the other base workers know nothing of the mind switch.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47a4c1aa7a2232627f466e80f32994f908d689b6","amp;dn":"The+Outer+Limits+-+The+Human+Factor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47a4c1aa7a2232627f466e80f32994f908d689b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,164,193,170,122,34,50,98,127,70,110,128,243,41,148,249,8,214,137,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
