At the core of the book is what the author calls Ã¢â‚¬Å“the state of presence,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a living in the Ã¢â‚¬Å“nowÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ that is both intensely inspirational and practical. When the pressures of future and past thinking disappear, fear and frustration also vanish, conquered by the moment. Stillness Speaks takes the form of 200 individual entries, organized into 10 topic clusters that range from &quot;Beyond the Thinking Mind&quot; to &quot;Suffering and the End of Suffering.&quot; The entries are concise and complete in themselves, but, read together, take on a transformative power.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3a2ce141de481d9747625cebdb9947c19ef364c","amp;dn":"Stillness+Speaks","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3a2ce141de481d9747625cebdb9947c19ef364c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,162,206,20,29,228,129,217,116,118,37,206,189,185,148,124,25,239,54,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
