They were originally established with American rock band Elf's members, but Blackmore fired all the members except Ronnie James Dio who would leave in 1979. Three British musicians joined in 1979, singer Graham Bonnet, keyboardist Don Airey, former Deep Purple bassist Roger Glover, and this line-up gave the band their commercial breakthrough with the single &quot;Since You Been Gone&quot;. Over the years Rainbow went through many line-up changes with no two studio albums featuring the same line-up. Other lead singers Joe Lynn Turner and Doogie White would follow, and the project consisted of numerous backing musicians. The band started out combining mystical lyric themes with neoclassical metal, but went in a more streamlined commercial style following Dio's departure from the group.\n\nRainbow were ranked No. 90 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock. The band has sold over 28 million albums worldwide and 4 million albums in the United States.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLong Live Rock 'n' Roll is the third studio album released by the British hard rock band Rainbow, released in 1978, and the last to feature American singer Ronnie James Dio.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRainbow:\n\n\nRonnie James Dio: lead vocals\n\nRitchie Blackmore: guitars, bass (also bass on rough mix tracks 1Ã¢â‚¬â€œ6, 2012 Deluxe Edition)\n\nCozy Powell: drums, percussion\n\nBob Daisley: bass on &quot;Gates of Babylon&quot;, &quot;Kill the King&quot;, and &quot;Sensitive to Light&quot;\n\nDavid Stone: keyboards on &quot;Gates of Babylon&quot;, &quot;Kill the King&quot;, &quot;The Shed&quot;.
