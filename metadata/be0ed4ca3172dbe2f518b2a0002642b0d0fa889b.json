Why does this seemingly abstract discipline provide the key to unlocking the deep secrets of the physical universe? How one answers these questions will significantly influence metaphysical thinking about reality.\n\nThis book is intended to fill a gap between popular 'wonders of mathematics' books and the technical writings of the philosophers of mathematics. The chapters are written by some of the world's finest mathematicians, mathematical physicists and philosophers of mathematics, each giving their perspective on this fascinating debate. Every chapter is followed by a short response from another member of the author team, reinforcing the main theme and raising further questions.\n\nAccessible to anyone interested in what mathematics really means, and useful for mathematicians and philosophers of science at all levels, Meaning in Mathematics offers deep new insights into a subject many people take for granted.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be0ed4ca3172dbe2f518b2a0002642b0d0fa889b","amp;dn":"Meaning+in+Mathematics+-+John+Polkinghorne.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be0ed4ca3172dbe2f518b2a0002642b0d0fa889b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,14,212,202,49,114,219,226,245,24,178,160,0,38,66,176,208,250,136,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
