According to TormÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©, the song was written during a blistering hot summer. In an effort to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œstay cool by thinking cool,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ the most-performed (according to BMI) Christmas song was born.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI saw a spiral pad on his piano with four lines written in pencil,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ TormÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© recalled. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThey started, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Chestnuts roasting ... Jack Frost nipping ... Yuletide carols ... Folks dressed up like Eskimos.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Bob (Wells, co-writer) didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t think he was writing a song lyric. He said he thought if he could immerse himself in winter he could cool off. Forty minutes later that song was written. I wrote all the music and some of the lyrics.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nThe Nat King Cole Trio first recorded the song early in 1946. At ColeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s behest ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and over the objections of his label, Capitol Records ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a second recording was made the same year utilizing a small string section, this version becoming a massive hit on both the pop and R&amp;B charts. Cole re-recorded the song in 1953, using the same arrangement with a full orchestra arranged and conducted by Nelson Riddle, and once more in 1961, in a stereophonic version with orchestra conducted by Ralph Carmichael. The latter recording is generally regarded as definitive and continues to receive considerable radio airplay each holiday season, while ColeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s original 1946 recording was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1974. Mel TormÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© himself eventually recorded his own versions in 1954 and again in 1965 and 1992.\n\nWhite Christmas is an album released by country singer Martina McBride on the RCA label in 1998. It was re-released in 1999 with new artwork and two new tracks. The album is a 12-track cover of famous Christmas songs.\n\nMcBride's official website does not list this album in her discography.\n\nAs of December 2009, the album is certified platinum and has sold 1.4 million copies in the United States according to Nielsen SoundScan.\n\nThe album was re-released in October 2007 with four new tracks.\n\nMartina McBride (born July 29, 1966, in Medicine Lodge, Kansas) is an American country music singer and songwriter. She is best-known for her inspirational-style ballads about women and children. McBride has been called the &quot;CÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©line Dion of Country Music&quot; for her big-voiced ballads and soprano range.\n\nMcBride was signed to RCA Records in 1991 and made her debut the following year as a neo-traditionalist country singer with the single, &quot;The Time Has Come.&quot; It was not until 1997, when she released her fourth album, Evolution, that she broke through into the country music industry with a new pop-styled crossover sound, similar to that of Faith Hill and Shania Twain. From that point on, McBride has had a string of major hit singles on the Billboard country chart and occasionally on the adult contemporary chart. Five of these singles went to #1 on the country chart between 1995 and 2001, and one peaked at #1 on the adult contemporary chart in 2003.\n\nMcBride has recorded a total of nine studio albums, one &quot;greatest hits&quot; compilation, one &quot;live&quot; album, a &quot;Christmas&quot; compilation, as well as two additional compilation albums. Seven of her studio albums and two of her compilations have received an RIAA certification of &quot;Gold&quot;, or higher. Worldwide, she has sold over 16 million albums. In addition, Martina has won the Country Music Association's &quot;Female Vocalist of the Year&quot; award four times (tied with Reba McEntire for the most wins) and the Academy of Country Music's &quot;Top Female Vocalist&quot; award three times.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:83069b4ee2d7de577c84bccda80ab353ad48ac07","amp;dn":"Martina+McBride+-+The+Christmas+Song+++%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"83069b4ee2d7de577c84bccda80ab353ad48ac07","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,6,155,78,226,215,222,87,124,132,188,205,168,10,179,83,173,72,172,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
