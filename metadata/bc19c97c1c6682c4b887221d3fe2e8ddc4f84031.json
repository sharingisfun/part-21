By analyzing the lives of such past masters as Charles Darwin, Benjamin Franklin, Albert Einstein, and Leonard da Vinci, as well as by interviewing nine contemporary masters, including tech guru Paul Graham and animal rights advocate Temple Grandin, Greene debunks our cultureÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s many myths about genius and distills the wisdom of the ages to reveal the secret to greatness. With this seminal text as a guide, readers will learn how to unlock the passion within and become masters.\n\nConsider a donation to: 1MMzqbUiRDf8am75qS5q3xiPrc616C6nvP","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc19c97c1c6682c4b887221d3fe2e8ddc4f84031","amp;dn":"Robert+Greene+-+Mastery+EPUB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc19c97c1c6682c4b887221d3fe2e8ddc4f84031","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,25,201,124,28,102,130,196,184,135,34,29,63,226,232,221,196,248,64,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
