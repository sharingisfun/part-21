It offers an extremely radical version of non-dualistic philosophy. The Gita insists on complete unreality of external world and absolute oneness of existence. It does not mention any morality or duties and therefore, is seen by commentators as 'godless'. It also dismisses names and forms as unreal and a sign of ignorance.(wiki)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f163d48c4c661bcdedfdf5d4d82b2e1f09489c83","amp;dn":"Ashtavakra+Gita","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f163d48c4c661bcdedfdf5d4d82b2e1f09489c83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,99,212,140,76,102,27,205,237,253,245,212,216,43,46,31,9,72,156,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
