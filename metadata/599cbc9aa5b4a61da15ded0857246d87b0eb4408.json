Lynne has produced recordings for artists such as The Beatles, Brian Wilson, Roy Orbison, Dave Edmunds, Del Shannon and Tom Petty. He has co-written songs with Petty and also with George Harrison, whose 1987 album Cloud Nine was co-produced by Lynne and Harrison. Among the many compositions to his credit are such well-known hits as &quot;Livin' Thing&quot;, &quot;Evil Woman&quot;, &quot;Turn to Stone&quot;, &quot;Do Ya&quot;, &quot;Xanadu&quot;, &quot;Strange Magic&quot;, &quot;Sweet Talkin' Woman&quot;, &quot;Telephone Line&quot;, &quot;Shine a Little Love&quot;, &quot;Mr. Blue Sky&quot;, &quot;Hold On Tight&quot;, &quot;All Over the World&quot;, and &quot;Don't Bring Me Down&quot;.\n\nIn 2008, The Washington Times named Lynne the fourth greatest record producer in music history.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Lynne&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Lynne&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTracklist &amp; Info:\n\nSide A: Doin' That Crazy Thing (3:25)\n\nSide B: Goin' Down To Rio (3:45)\n\n\n\nLabel: Jet/UA\n\nCat #: JT-DW1072\n\nCountry Of Origin: USA\n\nRelease Date: 1977\n\nTotal Play Time: 7 minutes 19 seconds\n\n\nThis 12&quot; disco single was released by Jeff Lynne right before ELO's &quot;Out Of The Blue&quot; LP. It's quite a snappy little disco number, with classic Jeff Lynne vocals. I suppose it's safe to assume that Jeff plays all the instruments. The single was a complete bomb and it is now hard to find. I found a sealed copy in the cutout bin many years ago. Here is a fresh transfer for your enjoyment.\nThe vinyl was transferred on a Sony PS-LX350H turntable with an AT-440MLa stylus into a Philips standalone CD Recorder and ripped to WAV with EAC. CoolEditPro was used for editing and mastering. EQ was adjusted and the volume was normalized to 98%. Pops and clicks were removed by hand. There was no noise reduction processing of any kind.\n\nTransferred &amp; Mastered by Needledrop - March 2008\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doin%27_That_Crazy_Thing_%28Jeff_Lynne_song%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doin%27_That_Crazy_Thing_%28Jeff_Lynne_song%29&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goin%27_Down_To_Rio_%28Jeff_Lynne_song%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goin%27_Down_To_Rio_%28Jeff_Lynne_song%29&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTracklist &amp; Info:\n\n01. Every Little Thing (12&quot; Remix) (Lynne) (7:56)\n02. Every Little Thing (Lynne) (3:44)\n03. I'm Gone (Lynne) (2:50)\n\n\n\n\nEvery Little Thing\n\nTaken from his first solo album, Armchair Theatre, released in June 1990, the single became a minor hit (#59) in the UK and at #9 on Billboard's Mainstream Rock Tracks chart in the US. It charted at #24 in Australia. Fellow Traveling Wilburys George Harrison and Tom Petty made cameo appearances in the music video, directed by Meiert Avis that received rotation on VH1 at the time.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Every_Little_Thing_%28Jeff_Lynne_song%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Every_Little_Thing_%28Jeff_Lynne_song%29&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nI'm Gone\n\nIt was recorded with the participation of the Traveling Wilburys (Tom Petty, Bob Dylan, George Harrison and Roy Orbison). It's B-side of the single Every Little Thing/I'm Gone.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%27m_Gone_%28Jeff_Lynne_song%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%27m_Gone_%28Jeff_Lynne_song%29&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTracklist &amp; Info:\n\n01. Lift Me Up (Lynne) (3:36)\n02. Sirens (Lynne) (3:47)\n03. Borderline (Lynne) (2:21)\n\n\n\n&quot;Every Little Thing&quot; and &quot;Lift Me Up&quot; were released as singles. The album also features two classic cover versions &quot;September Song&quot; and &quot;Stormy Weather&quot; the latter recorded as a tribute to his late mother. The album re-united Lynne with Electric Light Orchestra's keyboard player Richard Tandy and fellow Traveling Wilburys member George Harrison (both Harrison and the Wilburys were signed to Warner Bros. Records, parent of Reprise Records which released this album). Despite positive reviews the album became only a minor hit. It has been rumored that a re-release of Armchair Theatre is set along with his new, long awaited 2012 solo album.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lift_Me_Up_%28Jeff_Lynne_song%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lift_Me_Up_%28Jeff_Lynne_song%29&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirens_%28Jeff_Lynne_song%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirens_%28Jeff_Lynne_song%29&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHank Marvin (feat.
