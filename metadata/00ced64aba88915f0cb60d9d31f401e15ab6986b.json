The focus of Stamets&amp;#039; research is the Northwest&amp;#039;s native fungal genome, mycelium, but along the way he has filed 22 patents for mushroom-related technologies, including pesticidal fungi that trick insects into eating them, and mushrooms that can break down the neurotoxins used in nerve gas.\n\nThere are cosmic implications as well. Stamets believes we could terraform other worlds in our galaxy by sowing a mix of fungal spores and other seeds to create an ecological footprint on a new planet.\n\n    &quot;Once youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve heard &amp;#039;renaissance mycologist&amp;#039; Paul Stamets talk about mushrooms, you&amp;#039;ll never look at the world -- not to mention your backyard -- in the same way again.&quot;\n\nLinda Baker, Salon.com\n\nplease leave a comment if you want, this is just to show what is out there...\n\nAnd before you go and spam, dl it watch it and make up your own mind...\n\ncheers the_phyrexian\n\n\nAre you a British citizen?
