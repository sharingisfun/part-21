The four members of the combo were actually friends and acquaintances in different bands on the Tallahassee, FL, rock circuit before culling their skills together, along with lyrical assistance from young local poet and songwriter Linda Hargrove, when an opportunity to record an album in a Nashville studio presented itself. The resulting piece of work is the type of strangely compelling hybrid album that could only have come together in the musical gumbo of the post-psychedelic era. Drummer and primary vocalist Mark Ellerbee wrote most of the music, and his songs are basically freeform, open-ended tone poems that eschew typical verse-chorus and melodic considerations (although the odd melodic hook or harmony surfaces from time to time) for music that is much more amorphous and improvisational. There are elements of rock, R&amp;B, blues, progressive, classical, avant-garde composition, and, to an even greater degree, jazz weaving through the music, while a thick hallucinatory cloud hovers over the whole of the album, giving it an oddly surreal and even ghostly demeanor. It is a complex and ambitious mix that doesn't always come off seamlessly, but is by and large an engaging amalgam, exploring similar territory to that being investigated during the period by much higher profile bands such as Chicago, Procol Harum, and Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears.\n\n1 Intagible She 7:10\n2 Blue Satin 3:46\n3 Nothing Left to Do 7:07\n4 And I Will Follow 4:51\n5 Let It Fly 4:32\n5 Now What Are You Looking For 3:05\n6 A Face That Doesn't Matter 4:31\n7 Waiting 4:23\n\nRipped at 320 from CD.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0cfc3ed65d0f67b86d1c898d1ba728d9956c2c88","amp;dn":"After+All+-+After+All++1969+%28US+Psychodelic+Rock+320CDRip%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0cfc3ed65d0f67b86d1c898d1ba728d9956c2c88","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,252,62,214,93,15,103,184,109,28,137,141,27,167,40,217,149,108,44,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
