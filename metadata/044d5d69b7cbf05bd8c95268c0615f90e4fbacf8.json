The major element of interest is Levin's approach to Mozart's text--he decorates it freely, particularly in the slow movements. He also improvises cadenzas at the appropriate points. These are extremely daring elements of authentic performance practice because they depend not only on good scholarship but also on musical creativity. Levin's work is a triumphant success. Hear the way his embellishments on the slow movement of No. 23 intensify the emotional climate, and you'll realize that something has been missing in nearly all previous Mozart piano concerto recordings. The instruments, style, expressiveness, and recorded sound are all excellent. But the decorations make this disc unique and indispensable.\n\n                                                       --Leslie Gerber","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:044d5d69b7cbf05bd8c95268c0615f90e4fbacf8","amp;dn":"Classical+-+Mozart%3A+Piano+Concertos+-+Robert+Levin%2C+Hogwood%3B+AAM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"044d5d69b7cbf05bd8c95268c0615f90e4fbacf8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,77,93,105,183,203,240,91,216,201,82,104,192,97,95,144,228,251,172,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
