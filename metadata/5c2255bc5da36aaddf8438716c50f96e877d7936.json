Released in 1985 by Columbia Records, as both a five-LP and a three-compact disc set, it was the first compact disc box set retrospective issued for a musical artist.[citation needed] It reached #33 on the Billboard 200 in the US and has been certified platinum by the RIAA\nThe recordings on Biograph are a mix of rarities, hit singles, and album tracks. They are not presented in chronological order; 18 of its 53 tracks had not been previously issued, and three more had only been previously available on singles. The set comes accompanied with a 42-page booklet, containing rare photos and liner notes by Cameron Crowe, who interviews Dylan about each of the tracks. Nine of the ten tracks from Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits appear on this compilation..\n\n\nCD-01 - Track Listings\n\n[01] Lay Lady Lay\n[02] Baby, Let Me Follow You Down\n[03] If Not For You\n[04] I'll Be Your Baby Tonight\n[05] I'll Keep It With Mine\n[06] The Times They Are A-Changin'\n[07] Blowin' In The Wind\n[08] Masters Of War\n[09] Lonesome Death Of Hattie Carroll\n[10] Percy's Song\n[11] Mixed-Up Confusion\n[12] Tombstone Blues\n[13] Groom's Still Waiting At The Altar\n[14] Most Likely You Go Your Way And I'll Go Mine\n[15] Like A Rolling Stone\n[16] Lay Down Your Weary Tune\n[17] Subterranean Homesick Blues\n[18] I Don't Believe You (She Acts Like We Never Have Met)\n\n\tCD-01 Play Time - 01h:13m:18s\n\nCD-02 Track Listings\n\n[01] Visions Of Johanna\n[02] Every Grain Of Sand\n[03] Quinn The Eskimo\n[04] Mr. Tambourine Man\n[05] Dear Landlord\n[06] It Ain't Me, Babe\n[07] You Angel You\n[08] Million Dollar Bash\n[09] To Ramona\n[10] You're A Big Girl Now\n[11] Abandoned Love\n[12] Tangled Up In Blue\n[13] It's All Over Now, Baby Blue\n[14] Can You Please Crawl Out Your Window\n[15] Positively 4th Street\n[16] Isis\n[17] Jet Pilot\n\n\tCD-02 Play Time - 01h:11m:43s\n\nCD-03 Track Listings\n\n[01] Caribbean Wind\n[02] Up To Me\n[03] Baby, I'm In The Mood For You\n[04] I Wanna Be Your Lover\n[05] I Want You\n[06] Heart Of Mine\n[07] On A Night Like This\n[08] Just Like A Woman\n[09] Romance In Durango\n[10] SeÃƒÂ±or (Tales Of Yankee Power)\n[11] Gotta Serve Somebody\n[12] I Believe In You\n[13] Time Passes Slowly\n[14] I Shall Be Released\n[15] Knockin' On Heaven's Door\n[16] All Along The Watchtower\n[17] Solid Rock\n[18] Forever Young\n\n\tCD-03 Play Time - 01h:11m:27s\n\nTotal FLAC Play Time............ 03h:36m:29s\nTotal File Size....................... 1.33GB (Including FLACs, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat / Info.......................
