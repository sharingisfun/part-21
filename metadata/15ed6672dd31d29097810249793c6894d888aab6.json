It is a network of four art museums: Tate Britain, London (until 2000 known as the Tate Gallery, founded 1897), Tate Liverpool (founded 1988), Tate St Ives, Cornwall (founded 1993) and Tate Modern, London (founded 2000), with a complementary website, Tate Online (created 1998). Tate is not a government institution, but its main sponsor is the Department for Culture, Media and Sport\n\nThe gallery was founded in 1897, as the National Gallery of British Art. When its role was changed to include the national collection of modern art as well as the national collection of British art, in 1932, it was renamed the Tate Gallery after sugar magnate Henry Tate of Tate &amp; Lyle, who had laid the foundations for the collection.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:15ed6672dd31d29097810249793c6894d888aab6","amp;dn":"Tate+Gallery+London+-+A+Selection+%28Art+Paintings%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"15ed6672dd31d29097810249793c6894d888aab6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,237,102,114,221,49,210,144,151,129,2,73,121,60,104,148,216,136,170,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
