Prior to his match with Douglas, Holyfield delayed a potential fight with Mike Tyson, instead agreeing to face 42-year-old George Foreman for the titles should he defeat Douglas.[1] Since ending his 10-year retirement in 1987, Foreman was a perfect 24Ã¢â‚¬â€œ0, with 23 of his wins coming via knockout. With Foreman's popularity at an all-time high coupled with the fact that he could possibly become the oldest Heavyweight champion in boxing history, anticipation for the bout was high. As such, the two fighters received high payouts, Holyfield was guaranteed $20 million, while Foreman took home a guaranteed $12.5 million. Despite his age, the outspoken Foreman remained confident that he could dethrone Holyfield and in the months before the fight often said as much in the media.[2] Not to be outdone, Holyfield's manager Dan Duva lampooned Foreman's weight, infamously stating that the fight should be called &quot;The Real Deal&quot; vs. &quot;The Big Meal&quot; and &quot;Some people say George is as fit as a fiddle. But I think he looks more like a cello.&quot;[3]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4cda524264e0a2f72ce0e5c61f6a2e5d76a6f7a","amp;dn":"Evander+Holyfield+vs+George+Foreman.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4cda524264e0a2f72ce0e5c61f6a2e5d76a6f7a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,205,165,36,38,78,10,47,114,206,14,92,97,246,162,229,215,106,111,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
