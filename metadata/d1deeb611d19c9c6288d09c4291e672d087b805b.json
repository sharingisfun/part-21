He was a stable at the bars at Beco das Garrafas, the now legendary street in Copacabana (the 52nd Street of Brazilian jazz, if you will), were Brazilian musicians would jam all night with their visiting heroes from the US and a unique Brazilian version of bop and hard bop was born.  Meirelles recorded what is generally considered some of the first and best examples of Brazilian hard bop with his group 'Os Copa 5' ('the 5 cups').  The albums 'O Som' and 'O Novo Som', recorded in 1964 and '65 respectively, showed his adoration for North American jazz and at the same time featured great original compositions and soloing that could easily stand it's own against it's northern counterparts.\nHe also played and arranged for Jorge Ben, Edu Lobo, Flora Purim, Pery Ribeiro, Joao Donato and, and, and...\n\n'Tropical', recorded for the London label in 1969, was intended to be a 'groovy' 'easy listening' album with a solely commercial aim ( the cover picture says it all! ), but Meirelles recorded anything but an 'easy listening' session.  He selected material by jazz greats like Horace Silver, Cannonball Adderley or Charles Lloyd plus some more obvious choices you would expect on such an effort ( Taboo, Poinciana ) and turned them into catchy, danceable but also musically valuable pieces of jazz, that all show his own handwriting.  Unfortunately the album became a complete commercial failure and vanished into obscurity.&quot;\n\nPersonnel:\nJ.T.
