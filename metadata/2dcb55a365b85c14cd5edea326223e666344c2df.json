Boer, &quot;Introduction to Space Charge Effects in Semiconductors&quot;\nSpringer | 2010 | ISBN: 3642022359 | 331 pages | PDF\n\nThis book is the most comprehensive one to describe the basics of space-charge effects in semiconductors, starting from basic principles to advanced application in semiconducting devices. It uses detailed analyses of the transport, Poisson, and continuity equations to demonstrate the behavior of the solution curves of the complete set of field and current distributions, along with quantitative descriptions of the relevant band models of typical pn-junction and Schottky barrier devices. It emphasizes the relevance to actual devices and sets these results apart from more simple models of networks of diodes and resistors. The book is especially important for people interested in detail analysis of solar cells and their efficiencies.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2dcb55a365b85c14cd5edea326223e666344c2df","amp;dn":"Introduction+to+Space+Charge+Effects+in+Semiconductors+%282010%29+-+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2dcb55a365b85c14cd5edea326223e666344c2df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,203,85,163,101,184,92,20,205,94,222,163,38,34,62,102,99,68,194,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
