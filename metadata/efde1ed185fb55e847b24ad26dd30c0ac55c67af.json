This was the last film to be produced by his own production company (Associates &amp; Aldrich) and at his own studio (bought with incomes from his biggest hit, 'The Dirty Dozen'), before he was forced to sell  it after a series of commercial flops.\n\nAccording to IMDB, full running time is 128 minutes, but this one only runs 123, so it is possibly cut. I am unaware of its origin (wether some old, impossible-to-find VHS copy, more recent DVD or other release).\n\n\nStarring: Scott Wilson, Kim Darby, Irene Daily, Tony Musante, Ralph Waite and Robert Lansing among others.\n\n\n\nFiletype: .avi\n\nFile Size: 1,36 Gb\n\nResolution: 672x368\n\nFrame Rate: 25,0\n\n\nEnjoy-a-doodle-doo!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:efde1ed185fb55e847b24ad26dd30c0ac55c67af","amp;dn":"The+Grissom+Gang+%281971%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"efde1ed185fb55e847b24ad26dd30c0ac55c67af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,222,30,209,133,251,85,232,71,178,74,210,109,211,12,10,197,92,103,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
