I put forward some ideas on this subject in an essay in Life and Letters as far back as 1947; and this essay I may claim as pioneering in the modern understanding of Turner. It was followed by Ann L. Livermore's valuable essay on the relation of Turner and Thomson in 1957. In the past few years there has been work by J. Ziff and J. Gage; and at the same time a deepening in the general appreciation of Turner's art by such writers as Rothenstein and Butlin, Clare, Kenneth Clark, A. Stokes, Kitson, and others. A collection of Turner's verse has been edited by myself under the title of The Sunset Ship (Scorpion Press, 1966).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e117eb19dd996943a5b704feef98531313124523","amp;dn":"J.M.W.+Turner%2C+His+life+and+work+-+a+Critical+biography+%28Art+Pai","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e117eb19dd996943a5b704feef98531313124523","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,23,235,25,221,153,105,67,165,183,4,254,239,152,83,19,19,18,69,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
