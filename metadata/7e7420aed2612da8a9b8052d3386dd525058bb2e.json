Ashby\nEdition: 4th\nSeries: Engineering Materials\nPaperback: 496 pages\nPublisher: Butterworth-Heinemann; 4th edition (October 10, 2011)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0080966659\nISBN-13: 978-0080966656\n\nWidely adopted around the world, Engineering Materials 1 is a core materials science and engineering text for third- and fourth-year undergraduate students; it provides a broad introduction to the mechanical and environmental properties of materials used in a wide range of engineering applications. The text is deliberately concise, with each chapter designed to cover the content of one lecture. As in previous editions, chapters are arranged in groups dealing with particular classes of properties, each group covering property definitions, measurement, underlying principles, and materials selection techniques. Every group concludes with a chapter of case studies that demonstrate practical engineering problems involving materials.\n\nEngineering Materials 1, Fourth Edition is perfect as a stand-alone text for a one-semester course in engineering materials or a first text with its companion Engineering Materials 2: An Introduction to Microstructures and Processing, in a two-semester course or sequence.\n\nNew and Key Features Include:\n\nMany new design case studies and design-based examples\nRevised and expanded treatments of stress-strain, fatigue, creep, and corrosion\nAdditional worked examples-to consolidate, develop, and challenge\nCompendia of results for elastic beams, plastic moments, and stress intensity factors\nMany new photographs and links to Google Earth, websites, and video clips\nAccompanying companion site with access to instructors' resources, including a suite of interactive materials science tutorials, a solutions manual, and an image bank of figures from the book","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e7420aed2612da8a9b8052d3386dd525058bb2e","amp;dn":"Ashby%2C+Jones+-+Engineering+Materials+1+4e+%282011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e7420aed2612da8a9b8052d3386dd525058bb2e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,116,32,174,210,97,45,168,169,184,5,45,51,134,221,82,80,88,187,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
