He tries to get back to normal life, but he still lives a vacant life. He has an old friend, Yuka, who goes to the same high school. She always tries to cheer him up and he gradually gets better. But one day, the sky gets red and the moon becomes black all of a sudden. All people around Kakeru and Yuka disappear and mysterious figures roam around them. All they can do is just to run away from them. A while later, it all gets back to normal. But the Red Night suddenly happens to them again and again. They find out that there are four more humans who get involved in this mysterious phenomenon.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa9708cd7b515c9cc7ae6ffad0a048f748ba1078","amp;dn":"11+Eyes+CrossOver+%5BJAP%5D%5BPSP%5D%5Bgamerguuy%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa9708cd7b515c9cc7ae6ffad0a048f748ba1078","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,151,8,205,123,81,92,156,199,174,111,250,208,160,72,247,72,186,16,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
