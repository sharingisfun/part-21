Users are encouraged to send feedback to the project so that their ideas can be used to improve Linux Mint.\n\nBased on Debian and Ubuntu, it provides about 30,000 packages and one of the best software managers.\n\nIt's safe and reliable. Thanks to a conservative approach to software updates, a unique Update Manager and the robustness of its Linux architecture, Linux Mint requires very little maintenance (no regressions, no antivirus, no anti-spyware...etc).\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.linuxmint.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.linuxmint.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.linuxmint.com/download.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.linuxmint.com/download.php&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54a67cdd7a7b0af1620a1e65a559c6f931d58bf2","amp;dn":"Linux+Mint+12+KDE+DVD+64-bit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54a67cdd7a7b0af1620a1e65a559c6f931d58bf2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,166,124,221,122,123,10,241,98,10,30,101,165,89,198,249,49,213,139,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
