The tape is great balanced and \r\nvery clear audience recording. The sound seems to be recorded very close \r\nto the stage.\r\n\r\nSoundboard Source: \r\nIncomplete excellent soundboard recording. The recording is a very good \r\nbalanced professional board tape.\r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\n\r\nCD 1 - MATRIX\r\n1. Opening Announcements\r\n2. Rock And Roll\r\n3. Celebration Day\r\n4. Black Dog\r\n5.

The Ocean\r\n\r\nComments: \r\nAnother of the great 1973 US Tour shows ... from the onset the band is ready \r\nto play and they take no prisoners! The show, surprisingly, was followed by \r\na very long announcements: &quot;Led Zeppelin has asked if we can get a few things \r\nstraight tonight. Nobody around here digs any fireworks - please cool the \r\nfireworks. Please also, we have an area right here in front of the stage where \r\nwe have many optic effects that we need to get off tonight, that we can't have \r\nany chance of anybody bumping the stage 'cos it'll completely ruin them. Their \r\nshow usually runs about one hour and forty five minutes. If you can keep the \r\nfireworks down and keep everything off the front, Led Zeppelin would like to \r\nthank you and do about three hours tonight! So, sit back and stay cool and \r\nwe'll have a long great show this evening!&quot; The improvisations, especially \r\nNo Quarter and the immensely long Dazed And Confused are fresh and unique and \r\nsound very different from anything heard before. The end has very unusual and \r\nexciting rhythm structure in Whole Lotta Love and Robert screaming as the band \r\njam on the end of The Ocean","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71d21707ab4efcc23c3558537a1701d0e172d93a","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+-+1973.07.17+Seattle%2C+Washington+%28Matrix%29+MP3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71d21707ab4efcc23c3558537a1701d0e172d93a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,210,23,7,171,78,252,194,60,53,88,83,122,23,1,208,225,114,217,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
