The first episode was such an accurate parody of a bad phone-in show that many listeners were fooled into believing it was genuine, and thus complained to the BBC (see the press clippings section of this guide for more on this).\n\nThe BBC helped create this subterfuge by publishing a fake profile for Gary Bellamy on the Radio 4 website; setting up a phone number for the show (with a message saying that the line was busy); and dropping the credits to hide the fact the callers were actually actors.\n\nIt wasn't until almost a week later that the people behind the show were un-veiled as well known comedy actors\nSince then, the buzz around the show has died down, but the programme continues on with a loyal fan base.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/radio/down_the_line/episodes/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/radio/down_the_line/episodes/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nCast:\nRhys Thomas\nPaul Whitehouse\nCharlie Higson,\nSimon Day\nLucy Montgomery\nAmelia Bullmore\nMatt Lucas\nFelix Dexter\nMark Gatiss\nCatherine Tate\nArabella Weir\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDown The Line - S01 - E01 - Freedom Of Speech\nDown The Line - S01 - E02 - Religion\nDown The Line - S01 - E03 - Animals At War\nDown The Line - S01 - E04 - Crime\nDown The Line - S01 - E05 - Healthy Eating\nDown The Line - S01 - E06 - Equality\n\nDown The Line - S02 - E01 - War, Chocolate\nDown The Line - S02 - E02 - Bullying, Property Sales\nDown The Line - S02 - E03 - Immigration\nDown The Line - S02 - E04 - Plastic Surgery, Natural Disasters\nDown The Line - S02 - E05 - Global Warming\nDown The Line - S02 - E06 - Education, Ghosts\nDown The Line - S02 - ESP - Tony Blair Special\n\nDown The Line - S03 - E01 - Liberal Agenda Of Media, What Shall We Call A New Planet\nDown The Line - S03 - E02 - String Theory, Popular Science Fiction\nDown The Line - S03 - E03 - Technology, Communication\nDown The Line - S03 - E04 - The Elderly, Consumer Rights, The Countryside\nDown The Line - S03 - E05 - Olympics, Can We Trust The Media\nDown The Line - S03 - E06 - Bad Manners, Modern Liberal Parenting\nDown The Line - S03 - ESP - Credit Crunch\n\nDown The Line - S04 - E01\nDown The Line - S04 - E02 \nDown The Line - S04 - E03 \nDown The Line - S04 - E04\nDown The Line - S04 - E05 \nDown The Line - S04 - E06 \nDown The Line - S04 - E07\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAudio Format : MP3\nDuration Approx : 27mn 0s\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\nResolution : 16 bits\n\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nI post quite a few torrents if this site is down when I post a new one I don't have time to keep trying.\nIf it's down then it's skipped.\n\nYou can follow me on Twitter so you don't miss any\n\n\nOr add the RSS feed in uTorrent (In FEEDS on the left add)\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f4e48291fae524ae377d863bea07d4a3e83265c","amp;dn":"Down+The+Line+-+S01+to+04+-+Audio+Comedy+-+MP3+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f4e48291fae524ae377d863bea07d4a3e83265c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,78,72,41,31,174,82,74,227,119,216,99,190,160,125,74,62,131,38,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
