He first came to the attention of \nmany American morriconemovie watchers with his score for Sergio LeoneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe \nGood, The Bad and the UglyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ which starred Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef, and Eli \nWallach in the title roles.  The main theme of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Good, The Bad and the UglyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ \nfeaturing the whistling of Alessandro Alessandroni is thought to be one of the \ntwo or three most recognizable movie themes ever written.  The more than 400 \nfilm and TV scores that Morricone composed and arranged include ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe MissionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œOnce Upon a Time in AmericaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½Once Upon a Time in the WestÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFor a Fistful of \nDollarsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFor a Few Dollars MoreÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCinema ParadisoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLa Cage Aux FollesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ \n.  Music from all of these films and more is included on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Platinum \nCollectionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. \n\nItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s remarkable how the musical signature that is often used to evoke the \nromanticized historical American west is the sound of MorriconeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s film scores \nfor the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œspaghetti WesternsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ directed by Segio Leone and others such as Clint \nEastwoodÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s dollars trilogy and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œOnce Upon a Time in the WestÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.  Alt country and \nindie rock groups who write songs that are sometimes described as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œwidescreenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ \nsuch as Calexico are usually riffing on MorriconeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ideas. \n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Platinum CollectionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is a three CD set that includes 60 tracks taken from \nMorriconeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s film scores.  All of his well known themes are here and the \ncollection often includes more than one theme from a film.  In particular, three \ntracks from MorriconeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s award-winning score for ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe MissionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ are included (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½The \nMissionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGabrielÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s OboeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe FallsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½).  The material is not arranged \nchronologically or by film so that listeners who want to hear just the tracks \nfrom a particular movie will have to jump around over the three CDs to do so.  \nThis can be a royal pain in the ass but it has the benefit of encouraging you to \nplay each of the three CDs.  Familiar themes appear on each disc and you will \ndiscover many other tracks from films you may not be familiar with that you \nenjoy as much as the ones you know.  Listeners who only want the music from one \nor two films can buy the individual soundtracks.\n\nAs far as I now, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Platinum CollectionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is only available in the US as an \nimport on a German label.  The copy I have only includes a brief listing of \ntracks with copyright info by way of written material.  And itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s in Italian \nwhich I donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t read.  No matter, though, the music speaks for itself.\n\nWhen you think about it, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œspeaking for itselfÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, is a good characteristic for \nfilm music to have because many times the music in a film must speak for a \ncharacter, a time, a place, or a situation by conveying complex emotional \ninformation in a brief yet memorable way.  Morricone is a master at this and \nmany of the tracks on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Platinum CollectionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ speak eloquently indeed.  \nThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a reason why Morricone is so widely admired and that reason is on full \ndisplay across these three discs. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                           EXTRACT FROM EAC LOG FILE\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nExact Audio Copy V0.99 prebeta 4 from 23.

It's normal, after a few hours/days downloading and expecting a\nrelease, to feel deceived if it doesn't work properly, and expressing this is\nlegitimate.\n\nI've often found one comment (negative) on a movie/CD downloaded by 2000+ \npeople, and since that single negative feedback, people simply stop downloading \nand therefore, sharing.  But a few times it was due not to the torrent itself, \nbut to some issues on the downloader side (not updated codecs, misused \ntools...), and that's unfair for the person who took the time to share it for\nfree.\n\nIF YOU FIND THIS RELEASE DESERVES TO BE RECOMMENDED TO OTHERS, HELP BY DROPPING \nA LINE AFTER YOU'VE CHECKED IT.  This way, You'll help in keeping the torrent \nalive, almost as much as keeping it in your HDD until a 1:1 ratio is\nreached.\n\nThanks\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:725097ecbd9e5df4ed803b928fd9fce77193a536","amp;dn":"Ennio+Morricone+-+The+Platinum+Collection+%283-CD%29+%5BEAC-FLAC%5D+%5BReP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"725097ecbd9e5df4ed803b928fd9fce77193a536","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,80,151,236,189,158,93,244,237,128,59,146,143,217,252,231,113,147,165,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
