They were also nominated for a Grammy Award in 1987. After their third album Simple Mission and a brief Canadian tour in early 1993, the band went on a lengthy hiatus. Lead singer Alan Frew released two solo albums before the band reformed and began touring again around 2003.\n\nOn 6 November 2004 Glass Tiger hosted a Saturday night retro show on CIQB-FM in Barrie, Ontario under the direction of station program director Darren Stevens.\n\nIn 2005 the band released a new DVD collection No Turning Back. On 23 June 2005, they appeared on the NBC television show Hit Me Baby One More Time, performing their classic hit &quot;Don't Forget Me (When I'm Gone)&quot; and covering &quot;Everything You Want&quot; (originally recorded by Vertical Horizon). Although they lost the audience voting to Thelma Houston, Glass Tiger were judged the winners by online voters.\n\nIn a mid-2006 interview on Entertainment Tonight Canada, Glass Tiger hinted they were back in the studio to record new material. Meanwhile, the band continues to tour throughout Canada. A new DVD titled &quot;Glass Tiger Live in Concert&quot; featuring the band in concert from the 1980s was also released in 2006.\n\nIn March 2009, Glass Tiger and members of the NHL alumni visited Canadian Forces stationed in Kandahar, Afghanistan.[1][2] The visit included live performances and footage was shown on an episode of Entertainment Tonight Canada. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Thin Red Line 1986\n\n\nThe Thin Red Line is the debut album by Canadian band Glass Tiger.
