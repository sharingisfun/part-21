Between the band's 16 albums and DVDs, Triumph has received 18 gold and 9 platinum awards in Canada and the United States. Triumph was nominated for multiple Juno Awards, including Group of the Year Award in 1979, 1985, 1986 and 1987.\n\nLike their fellow Canadians Rush, Triumph began building their reputation across North America as a live band, peaking in the early to mid-1980s.
