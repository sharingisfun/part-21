Bolstered by the Top 10 hit single &quot;Beverly Hills&quot;, it gave Weezer their biggest chart album peak yet, hitting #11 in the UK, #1 in Canada, and #2 in the U.S., where it went gold quickly, and eventually platinum. The song also earned the band their first Grammy nomination for Best Rock Song. Despite this, Make Believe has received mixed reviews from critics and fans, though it has remained a consistent seller.\n\nTrack listing\n\n\n   1. &quot;Beverly Hills&quot; ? 3:16\n   2. &quot;Perfect Situation&quot; ? 4:15\n   3. &quot;This Is Such a Pity&quot; ? 3:24\n   4. &quot;Hold Me&quot; ? 4:22\n   5. &quot;Peace&quot; ? 3:53\n   6. &quot;We Are All on Drugs&quot; ? 3:35\n   7. &quot;The Damage in Your Heart&quot; ? 4:02\n   8. &quot;Pardon Me&quot; ? 4:15\n   9. &quot;My Best Friend&quot; ? 2:47\n  10. &quot;The Other Way&quot; ? 3:16\n  11. &quot;Freak Me Out&quot; ? 3:26\n  12. &quot;Haunt You Every Day&quot; ? 4:37\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dad3547aebb4c6c7b650d600a293f9d9ed7f6fa8","amp;dn":"Weezer+-+Make+Believe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dad3547aebb4c6c7b650d600a293f9d9ed7f6fa8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,211,84,122,235,180,198,199,182,80,214,0,162,147,249,217,237,127,111,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
