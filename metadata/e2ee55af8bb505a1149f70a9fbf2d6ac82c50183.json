Read all about an amateur film of the assassination, eyewitness testimony and documents that Rabin appeared unhurt from shots fired at the notorious peace rally. It is the very same footage that clearly shows a back door of Rabin&amp;#039;s empty limousine slammed shut from inside before the Prime Minister was pushed into the vehicle. Who was waiting for him? What happened during the limousine&amp;#039;s abnormally long detour en route to the hospital? At whose hands did Rabin really die? Who Murdered Yitzhak Rabin is a tirelessly investigated expose of the assassination of Israel&amp;#039;s prime minister Yitzhak Rabin who, as this amazing book claims, wasn&amp;#039;t murdered by the hand of a lone assassin but instead by a well conceived conspiracy that among others involved many of Israeli politicians who still rule Israel today. 360 pages, many pictures. A must read for everyone.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e2ee55af8bb505a1149f70a9fbf2d6ac82c50183","amp;dn":"Chamish+-+Who+Murdered+Yitzhak+Rabin+%282007%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e2ee55af8bb505a1149f70a9fbf2d6ac82c50183","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,238,85,175,139,181,5,161,20,159,112,169,251,242,214,172,130,197,1,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
