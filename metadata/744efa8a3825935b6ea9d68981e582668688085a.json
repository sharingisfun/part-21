He asks the burglar to do the job (for money) but the burglar puts it off for a day; meanwhile he subcontracts the deed to another guy. Meanwhile the suicide has ended up in a night club and fallen in love - life doesn't seem so bad after all. Now he must go through a series of misadventures to recall the contract.\n\nAn early sound film, sometimes it seems like a silent. Now it is mostly known as the point of origin for the song &quot;Wenn Ich mir was wuenschen duerfte&quot;, since made famous by many singers.\n\nIn flv format, plays on VLC.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:744efa8a3825935b6ea9d68981e582668688085a","amp;dn":"Der+Mann%2C+der+seinen+Moerder+sucht+%281931%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"744efa8a3825935b6ea9d68981e582668688085a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,78,250,138,56,37,147,91,110,169,214,137,129,229,130,102,134,136,8,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
