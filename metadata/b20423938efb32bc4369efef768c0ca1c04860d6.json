Although the dozen biographies devoted to RimbaudÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life depend on one main source for informationÃ¢â‚¬â€his own correspondenceÃ¢â‚¬â€a complete edition of these remarkable letters has never been published in English. Until now.\n\nA moving document of decline, RimbaudÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s letters begin with the enthusiastic artistic pronouncements of a fifteen-year-old genius, and end with the bitter what-ifs of a man whose life has slipped disastrously away. But whether soapboxing on the essence of art, or struggling under the yoke of self-imposed exile in the desert of his later years, Rimbaud was incapable of writing an uninteresting sentence. As translator and editor Wyatt Mason makes clear in his engaging Introduction, the letters reveal a Rimbaud very different from our expectations. RimbaudÃ¢â‚¬â€presented by many biographers as a bohemian wild manÃ¢â‚¬â€is unveiled as Ã¢â‚¬Å“diligent in his pursuit of his goals . . . wildly, soberly ambitious, in poetry, in everything.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b20423938efb32bc4369efef768c0ca1c04860d6","amp;dn":"I+Promise+to+Be+Good+-+The+Letters+of+Arthur+Rimbaud","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b20423938efb32bc4369efef768c0ca1c04860d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,4,35,147,142,251,50,188,67,105,239,239,118,140,12,161,192,72,96,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
