Since time immemorial, tales of his adventures have resounded throughout the halls of gods and men alike.  This most interesting three-issue series explores what happens when Sigurd and his colleagues, wise Balduur, rakish Honir, and caustic Heimdall, discover that Valhalla is not the only mythic realm.  Everything is not as it seems in the newly unified Mythlands, and Sigurd's latest exploit could be his last!\n\nAlso included in this torrent:  the new version of the spinoff, Captain Victory (six issues); and the new version of the spinoff, Silver Star (six issues.)\n\nEnjoy, and please seed.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0563ffe35ced67c96c1fd17e55b063e7b58d0b5e","amp;dn":"Kirby%3A++Genesis","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0563ffe35ced67c96c1fd17e55b063e7b58d0b5e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,99,255,227,92,237,103,201,108,31,209,126,85,176,99,231,181,141,11,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
