Kicking off in the 60s with The Rockin&amp;#039; Vickers and Sam Gopal and culminating in his collaboration with Dave Grohl on the Probot project in 2004, this 2CD anthology of course includes the inevitable &quot;Silver Machine&quot; marking Lemmy&amp;#039;s time with Hawkwind and a pick of MotÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rhead tracks - &quot;Damage Case&quot;, &quot;Iron Horse&quot;, and more. Also included are Lemmy&amp;#039;s less well known collaborations with other artists including The Ramones (&quot;R.A.M.O.N.E.S&quot;), The Damned (&quot;Ballroom Blitz&quot;), Wendy O&amp;#039;Williams of the Plasmatics (&quot;Stand By Your Man&quot;) and of course Girlschool and the UK top 5 hit (&quot;Please Don&amp;#039;t Touch&quot;). \n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nAlthough he&amp;#039;ll forever be the &quot;face&quot; of one of metal&amp;#039;s all-time great bands, MotÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rhead, Lemmy Kilmister also managed to lay down an assortment of non-MotÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rhead tracks over the years -- as evidenced by 2006&amp;#039;s Damage Case: Lemmy Anthology. A handful of MotÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rhead tracks are indeed included, but Damage Case is not your typical zillionth MotÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rhead/Lemmy collection, as it traces all of the singer/bassist&amp;#039;s standout tracks from his very first band, the Rockin&amp;#039; Vickers (a.k.a. &quot;The Rockin&amp;#039; Vicars&quot; or &quot;The Wild Ones&quot;), all the way to his participation in Dave Grohl&amp;#039;s much publicized Probot project. As proven throughout the 31-track collection, Lemmy has always kept things rough and gritty -- and should be commended (especially when seemingly all the veteran rock acts were softening up their sound and reaching for the hair spray come the mid- to late &amp;#039;80s). Included is the Lemmy-sung (but not written) Hawkwind classic &quot;Silver Machine&quot;, as well as raucous duets with both Girlschool (&quot;Please Don&amp;#039;t Touch&quot;) and the late/great Wendy O. Williams (&quot;Stand by Your Man&quot;). Wrapping up the album is a barrage of covers that have been rescued from &quot;tribute album hell&quot;, including a pair of Metallica tunes (&quot;Enter Sandman&quot; and &quot;Whiplash&quot;), Queen (&quot;Tie Your Mother Down&quot;), Johnny Cash (&quot;Big River&quot;), and Iron Maiden (&quot;The Trooper&quot;), among others. Also included are Lemmy&amp;#039;s aforementioned Probot track (&quot;Shake Your Blood&quot;) and MotÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rhead&amp;#039;s tribute to the Ramones, &quot;R.A.M.O.N.E.S.&quot;, the latter track being one that Lemmy should be given credit for penning -- he was one of the few rockers to voice his admiration of the N.Y.C. band while it was still a functioning unit. If you&amp;#039;re looking to dig deeper than the average MotÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rhead compilation, Damage Case: Lemmy Anthology is certain to get your head a-banging.
