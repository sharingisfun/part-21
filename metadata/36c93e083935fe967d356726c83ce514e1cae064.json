Much like 1996's Slang, it featured another departure from their signature sound by moving into the pop genre. The album charted at No. 11 on The Billboard 200# and No. 14 on the UK Albums Chart. \n\nMost of the album was produced by Pete Woodroffe and the band, with remaining tracks produced by either Marti Frederiksen or Per Aldeheim and Andreas Carlsson. This is the first Def Leppard album in which drummer Rick Allen actively took part in song-writing. On all of the band's prior albums, he is only credited with helping co-write 3 tracks. On this album alone, he co-wrote 11.\n\nThe album features the Roman numeral 'X', recognising it as their tenth album release, although the album is in fact only their eighth collection of all-new studio material. The other two albums released by the band prior to the release of X, Retro Active and Vault, were a rerecording of B-sides and rarities and a greatest hits set respectively.\n\nMP3 - 320kbs\n  \nNo. \t\t\n1. \t&quot;Now&quot;   \t \t3:58\n2. \t&quot;Unbelievable&quot;   \t3:58\n3. \t&quot;You're So Beautiful&quot;  \t3:31\n4. \t&quot;Everyday&quot;   \t \t3:08\n5. \t&quot;Long, Long Way to Go&quot;  4:38\n6. \t&quot;Four Letter Word&quot;   \t3:07\n7. \t&quot;Torn to Shreds&quot;   \t2:56\n8. \t&quot;Love Don't Lie&quot;   \t4:46\n9. \t&quot;Gravity&quot;   \t\t2:33\n10. \t&quot;Cry&quot;   \t\t3:17\n11. \t&quot;Girl Like You&quot;   \t2:49\n12. \t&quot;Let Me Be the One&quot;   \t3:29\n13. \t&quot;Scar&quot;   \t\t4:59\n14. \t&quot;Kiss the Day&quot;   \t4:27\n\nPlease Dont Hit And Run !\n\nAnd Please Feel free to Comment, Reguest and tell me what you like :D","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36c93e083935fe967d356726c83ce514e1cae064","amp;dn":"Def+Leppard+-+%5B2002%5D+X+%5B320kbs%5D+%7E%7ERenovatio%7E%7E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36c93e083935fe967d356726c83ce514e1cae064","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,201,62,8,57,53,254,150,125,53,103,38,200,60,229,20,225,202,224,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
