Guess what the comics are about! :P\n\n         This one was a bit of a challenge, because there are a bunch of scans of a\n         bunch of editions of a bunch of miniseries, with very little in the way of\n         accessible documentation. It seems to come down to this, broadly speaking:\n         The original publisher, Ground Zero, produced four trilogies (and a handful\n         of cross-overs and stuff, which I gave up on right away) from 92-96, which\n         were then re-released, somewhat censored for nudity, under a &quot;Fangs of the\n         Widow&quot; banner from 95-97. Then Avatar took over the title, produced a fifth\n         trilogy from 97-98, and proceeded to re-release the earlier ones yet again\n         beginning in 99, under a &quot;Widow X&quot; banner - this time with *added* explicit\n         sex scenes, however! Of course, I used those editions preferrentially, with\n         the original ones as a fallback and the defanged &quot;Fangs&quot; issues as a last\n         recourse only! In short, while this torrent is by no means exhaustive, it\n         does have optimal versions of all of the big-ticket items, I believe! :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dbd935bb5a5b84d96a4086ed4815ca3da35489f9","amp;dn":"%5BHiFi%7CEros%5D+Mike+Wolfer%3A+Widow+%28Ground+Zero%2FAvatar%29+%281992-2000%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dbd935bb5a5b84d96a4086ed4815ca3da35489f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,217,53,187,90,91,132,217,106,64,134,237,72,21,202,61,163,84,137,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
