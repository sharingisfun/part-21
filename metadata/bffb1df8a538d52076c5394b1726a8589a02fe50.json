Bill Graham was booking them to open for 10 years After, Big Brother &amp; the Holding Company, Hot Tuna and more. Eventually he called their management into his office and let them know that he needed bands that had an LP out with airplay. In 2002, Gold's Album &quot;Mission Rock&quot; recorded in '71 was released. After 32 years, finally the LP Graham had wanted to hear!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bffb1df8a538d52076c5394b1726a8589a02fe50","amp;dn":"Gold+-+Gold+%281969+US+West+Coast+Psych%29+%28Vinyl+Rip%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bffb1df8a538d52076c5394b1726a8589a02fe50","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,251,29,248,165,56,213,32,118,197,57,75,23,38,168,88,154,2,254,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
