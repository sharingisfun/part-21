Everyone from novices to experienced researchers can turn to this book to find the essential equations, theories, and working tools needed to conduct and interpret contemporary research. Expertly organized, the book.\n\n    Summarizes the core theories common to chemistry and physics\n\n    Introduces topics and techniques that lay the foundations of instrumentation\n\n    Discusses basic as well as advanced instrumentation and experimental methods\n\n    Guides readers from crystals to nanoparticles to single molecules\n\nReaders gain access to not only the core concepts of the physical sciences, but also the underlying mathematics. Among the topics addressed are mechanics, special relativity, electricity and magnetism, quantum chemistry, thermodynamics, electrochemistry, symmetry, solid state physics, and electronics. The book also addresses energy and electrical sources, detectors, and algorithms. Moreover, it presents state-of-the-technology instrumentation and techniques needed to conduct successful experiments.\n\nEach chapter includes problems and exercises ranging from easy to difficult to help readers master core concepts and put them into practice. References lead to more specialized texts so that readers can explore individual topics in greater depth.\n\nThe Physical Chemist's Toolbox is recommended not only as a general reference, but also as a textbook for two-semester graduate courses in physical and analytical chemistry.\n\n\n\nHardcover: 960 pages\nPublisher: Wiley; 2 edition (April 10, 2012)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 047088925X\nISBN-13: 978-0470889251","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47efe2b6619831569d83df68ddce11a7e449e91c","amp;dn":"The+Physical+Chemist%27s+Toolbox+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47efe2b6619831569d83df68ddce11a7e449e91c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,239,226,182,97,152,49,86,157,131,223,104,221,206,17,167,228,73,233,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
