Capturing all the drama inherent in Eastern European folk styles and pairing it with the more dramatic end of indie rock (think Arcade Fire or Calexico), Devotchka carve out a rich little niche for itself. The band tips its glass to a number of influences on this six-song E.P - along with the original title track, the band offers up covers that range from Siouxsie And The Banshees&amp;#039; &quot;The Last Beat Of My Heart&quot; to the Velvet Underground&amp;#039;s &quot;Venus And Furs&quot; to the Sinatra tune &quot;Something Stupid.&quot; Regardless of the source material, the band wholly remakes each tune, skillfully playing a mariachi band on &quot;El Zopilote Mojado&quot; or the moody troubadour on the title song. It all fits together like a jigsaw puzzle with no pieces missing, proving that this band&amp;#039;s interpretive skills are just as strong as its compositional ones. -- Tad Hendrickson\n\nMad props to Xiomara - the coolest pirate chick, ever!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:52881a1395b44d7ba5dc318ab7d0a9a6af68f06f","amp;dn":"DeVotchka+-+Curse+Your+Little+Heart","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"52881a1395b44d7ba5dc318ab7d0a9a6af68f06f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,136,26,19,149,180,77,123,165,220,49,138,183,208,169,166,175,104,240,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
