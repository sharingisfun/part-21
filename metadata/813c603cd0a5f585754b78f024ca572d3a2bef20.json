It was their  \n          last studio album featuring vocalist/drummer Phil Collins, who would leave Genesis   \n          amicably in 1996 before returning for 2007's Turn It on Again: The Tour.             \n                                                                                               \n          We Can't Dance was Genesis' first studio album in five years, following the          \n          international success of Invisible Touch in 1986. We Can't Dance reached #1 in the UK\n          and #4 in the US, selling several million copies (including 4 million in the US      \n          alone). The album also spawned several hit singles, including &quot;No Son of Mine&quot;, &quot;Hold\n          on My Heart&quot;, &quot;I Can't Dance&quot; and &quot;Jesus He Knows Me&quot;, the latter two supported by   \n          humorous videos. Two songs were cut from the album, due to the fact &quot;there wasn't    \n          enough room on the record.&quot; These two songs are &quot;On the Shoreline&quot;, and &quot;Hearts on   \n          Fire&quot;. Both songs were released as B-Sides.                                          \n                                                                                               \n                                                                                               \n                 Album opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic,            \n                 HHI does not express an opinion either way with regard to the quality         \n                 of the band etc. We hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!                  \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:813c603cd0a5f585754b78f024ca572d3a2bef20","amp;dn":"Genesis-We_Cant_Dance-%28Retail%29-1991-HHI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"813c603cd0a5f585754b78f024ca572d3a2bef20","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,60,96,60,208,165,245,133,117,75,120,240,36,202,87,45,58,43,239,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
