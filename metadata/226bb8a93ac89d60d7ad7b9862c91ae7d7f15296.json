As guilty a pleasure as those songs were, however, they often outclassed the movies they were soundtracking by a wide margin -- sometimes, indeed, they were the only reason to bother with the films. This 19-track compilation cuts out the middleman, in a sense, by gathering rock &amp; surf songs from numerous such 1963-1965 movies, enabling us to hear the goods without suffering through the scripts. Despite the presence of some hitmakers and major stars, it's hardly deathless music -- only the Beach Boys' gorgeous ballad &quot;Girls on the Beach&quot; is truly excellent, though Jan &amp; Dean's 1964 Top 20 hit &quot;Ride the Wild Surf&quot; and the Astronauts' ripping instrumental &quot;Surf Party&quot; are quite good. Taken in the spirit in which it's intended, however, it's a fun (if slightly trashy) romp through the lighter side of the sun-baked pop/rock of the era. Virtually all of the artists on the CD -- including Frankie Avalon, Annette Funicello, Dick Dale, the Exciters, Donna Loren, the Pyramids, the Kingsmen, Nancy Sinatra, and the Rip Chords -- had a hit of some sort, even if these particular numbers don't include those hits, or even feature those performers at their best. As compensation, though, even the dumbest numbers -- the Kingsmen's &quot;How to Stuff a Wild Bikini&quot; takes the prize, though Annette's &quot;Pajama Party&quot; isn't far behind -- offer some crass if relatively disposable fun. Some of the other tracks aren't without their interest, even viewed apart from the popular culture angle: Frankie Avalon rocks about as hard as he ever did (though not exactly frenetically) on the 1963 single &quot;Don't Stop Now,&quot; Donna Loren does a decent tune in the soulful girl group vein with &quot;It Only Hurts When I Cry,&quot; and Nancy Sinatra's &quot;Geronimo&quot; predates her big Lee Hazlewood-produced hits. Surf/California expert Stephen J. McParland supplies fine, detailed liner notes.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/summer-beach-party-r844443/review&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/summer-beach-party-r844443/review&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000FVBL98&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000FVBL98&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
