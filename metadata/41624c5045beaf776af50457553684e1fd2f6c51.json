Horrible and unexplained murders have Gotham City held captive. Bizarre deaths have been occurring throughout the city, but the perpetrator is unknown. Even when the crimes have been committed in view of witnesses, all that is seen is a glimpse of a weird, skinless man who seems to fade away after the crimes. Gotham's only hope is their Dark Knight Detective, but how can Batman find and fight an Invisible Man?&quot;\n\nThanks to Minutemen-PhD for these awesome digital copies. Please seed, and enjoy! :-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41624c5045beaf776af50457553684e1fd2f6c51","amp;dn":"Batman+-+Unseen+01-05+%282009-2010%7CDigital%7CMinutemen-PhD%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41624c5045beaf776af50457553684e1fd2f6c51","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,98,76,80,69,190,175,119,106,245,4,87,85,54,132,225,253,47,108,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
