Birds\n\nPoor Moon carries much more weight than your typical indie rock debut. A &quot;supergroup&quot; only in the most local sense, this Pacific Northwest quartet represents a who's who of acts regional and national: Singer/guitarist/primary songwriter Christian Wargo has played with Pedro the Lion and Danielson Famile, Casey Wescott with Crystal Skulls, and Ian Murray and Peter Murray with Seattle un-Googleables the Christmas Cards. But let's not bury the lede: The closest and weightiest association is with Fleet Foxes, which claims both Wargo and Wescott as prominent members.\nIt's inevitable that Poor Moon will be compared to Fleet Foxes, which would be a daunting prospect for any band but especially for an offshoot. Their aesthetics and approaches are strikingly similar, right down to the gentle reverb and some of the record-collection touchstones: Crosby Stills &amp; Nash, Judee Sill, Buffy Sainte-Marie, to name a few. Every song on Poor Moon turns on some sonic flourish or instrumental shift that occasionally comes across as showy but more often than not works well to give each song a distinctive identity, whether it's the chimes and celeste on &quot;Bucky Pony&quot; or the whistled birdsong of the too-precious opener &quot;Clouds Below&quot;. There are certainly moments that sound suspiciously familiar, like the reverb-swaddled vocals on &quot;Holiday&quot; or the soft crash of drums and guitar on &quot;Same Way&quot;. Poor Moon either shows how closely Wargo and Wescott hew to the Fleet Foxes approach or demonstrates how essential they are to that band's celebrated sound.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a7cd6fc08dc38990ab2d99d7817755dc0070a02","amp;dn":"Poor+Moon+-+Poor+Moon+%282012%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a7cd6fc08dc38990ab2d99d7817755dc0070a02","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,124,214,252,8,220,56,153,10,178,217,157,120,23,117,93,192,7,10,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
