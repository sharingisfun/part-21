Bassam &quot;Barry&quot; Al-Fayeed, the youngest son of a war-torn country's controversial dictator, returns to his homeland after a self-imposed 20-year exile in America for his nephew's wedding. Upon his return, Barry is immediately thrown back into the familial and national politics of his youth. He braces himself to confront the stark realities of his father and older brother Jamal's harsh rule, and finds himself at odds with Jamal's wife, Leila, who strongly believes in a firm, unforgiving regime. Although his wife, Molly, struggles to comprehend her husband's apprehension, Barry is unable and unwilling to make his all-American family understand his unease over returning home. Emma, their 17-year-old daughter, adores her father and shares his disdain for the extravagances of her extended family. Meanwhile, their son, 16-year-old Sammy, revels in the lavish lifestyle their &quot;royal&quot; status brings, but dangerously tests cultural divides with his poorly disguised interest in handsome family bodyguard Abdul (Mehdi Dehbi). Barry's only warm memory of his childhood, boyhood friend Fauzi, wants nothing to do with him. Fauzi is now a journalist, whose reports on the abuses of the Al-Fayeed rule resulted in his arrest and torture. Barry must now confront the life he once fled. With his father's health in decline, everyone Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Jamal, their mother Amira, their father's top advisor Yussef, and even easygoing U.S. diplomat John Tucker Ã¢â‚¬â€œ expects him to assume a more active role in both the family and the regime\n|\naspect ratio...640x360\nframe rate...25\nbit rate...520 - 775\naudio mp3 stereo...96... 48khz\ncodec...Xvid avi\nre-converted using FORMAT FACTORY\ni download the smallest files i can find and re-convert them to xvid avi for my own use as  i  can't play any other format on my player so i thought i would upload them for anyone else who might  be able to use them ,i dont have a very fast upload speed so please be patient\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e936f8e1d01f3ddbb4db3dc77f302e55dcbc51c7","amp;dn":"Tyrant.S01E01.Xvid-AJAXEN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e936f8e1d01f3ddbb4db3dc77f302e55dcbc51c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,54,248,225,208,31,61,219,180,219,61,199,127,48,46,85,220,188,81,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
