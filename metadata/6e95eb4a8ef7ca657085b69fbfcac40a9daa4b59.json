So snowy in fact, that Simon Munnery spent the day stuck on the M40, and didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t make it for his recording. This gave Tony the opportunity to perform an unrehearsed and unplanned twenty five minute long second half. Anything could happen! \n\n\n\n\nVideo:624x416, 960kbps, 128k MP3 Audio\n\n\n\n\n---------------------\nIf you like this then buy the DVD from gofasterstripe for over an hours worth of extras.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e95eb4a8ef7ca657085b69fbfcac40a9daa4b59","amp;dn":"Tony+Law+-+Brainporium+-+DVDRip+XviD-iTeM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e95eb4a8ef7ca657085b69fbfcac40a9daa4b59","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,149,235,74,142,247,202,101,112,133,182,159,191,202,196,10,157,170,75,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
