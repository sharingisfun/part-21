Isa moves in with Marie, who's flat-sitting for a mother and child in hospital in comas following a car crash. Isa is out-going, unskilled, with hopes of moving south to warmer climes. Marie usually is either angry or detached. Then, while Isa begins to visit the child in whose flat they live, going to hospital to read to her, Marie slowly falls for a rich youth. At first Marie keeps him at bay, then she not only pursues him, she begins to dream he is her life's love. When Isa tries to warn Marie, their friendship flounders. How will Marie handle the inevitable? And once they lose the flat, where will they go?\n\nhttp://imdb.com/title/tt0120449/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:664e27f8cbc41ac985c9d3317cbc3e879af225e4","amp;dn":"Dreamlife+of+Angels+DVDRip+DivX+1CD+PL+ENG+Sub%28txt%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"664e27f8cbc41ac985c9d3317cbc3e879af225e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,78,39,248,203,196,26,201,133,201,211,49,124,188,62,135,154,242,37,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
