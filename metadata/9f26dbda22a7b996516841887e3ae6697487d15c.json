Twista&amp;#039;s fast delivery and sharp verses make him one of the greatest guest rappers in the game, but his iffy relationship with the full-length remains intact, since Adrenaline Rush 2007 is about five cuts too long and shamelessly panders to radio with some uninspired, over-polished moments. &quot;Give It Up&quot; with Pharrell sounds like a track the producer designed for Gwen Stefani, while the too-smooth &quot;Love Rehab&quot; with R. Kelly is only interesting when Twista thanks his beloved for concealing a weapon from the police. While it&amp;#039;s moments like these that make the album&amp;#039;s title feel like an afterthought, &quot;Say Say&quot; with Cee-Lo and Jazze Pha is filled with infectious hip-hop nostalgia and old-school spirit. &quot;Seven Day Hustle&quot; and &quot;The Come Up&quot; are dedications to hip-hop in motion, while the grimey and satisfying &quot;Trouble&quot; could have fallen off the original Adrenaline Rush. Thanks to an infectious hook and prime sparring between Lil Wayne and Twista, &quot;Whip Game Proper&quot; is a crowd-pleaser that doesn&amp;#039;t pander. Little else will have appeal past the hardcore fan base, but they&amp;#039;ve always been better than most at ignoring the man&amp;#039;s shortcomings (limited subject matter, only one style of delivery) and focusing on his strengths (amazing speed and a punch-in-the-gut kind of wit).\n\nReleases\n\nYear \tType \tLabel \tCatalog #:\n2007 \tCD \tAtlantic \t274044\n \n\tLP \tAtlantic \t274044\n\n\nEnjoy!!\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.dpbolvw.net/click-2835923-10517765&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.dpbolvw.net/click-2835923-10517765&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.vmcsatellite.com/?aid=20849&amp;subaid=15&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.vmcsatellite.com/?aid=20849&amp;subaid=15&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.pwc.hostrocket.com/webhosting.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.pwc.hostrocket.com/webhosting.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f26dbda22a7b996516841887e3ae6697487d15c","amp;dn":"Twista+-+Adrenaline+Rush+2007+%282007%29+-+By+PWConnections","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f26dbda22a7b996516841887e3ae6697487d15c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,38,219,218,34,167,185,150,81,104,65,136,126,58,230,105,116,135,209,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
