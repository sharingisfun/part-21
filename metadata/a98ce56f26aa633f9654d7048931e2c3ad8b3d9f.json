Robb - Kindred in Death (In Death #29) - Retail (epub)\n\n\nWhen the newly promoted captain of the NYPSD and his wife return a day early from their vacation, they were looking forward to spending time with their bright and vivacious sixteen-year-old daughter who had stayed behind.\n\n\nNot even their worst nightmares could have prepared them for the crime scene that awaited them instead. Brutally murdered in her bedroom, Deena's body showed signs of trauma that horrified even the toughest of cops; including our own Lieutenant Eve Dallas, who was specifically requested by the captain to investigate.\n\nWhen the evidence starts to pile up, Dallas and her team think they are about to arrest their perpetrator; little do they know yet that someone has gone to great lengths to tease and taunt them by using a variety of identities. Overconfidence can lead to careless mistakes. But for Dallas, one mistake might be all she needs to bring justice.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a98ce56f26aa633f9654d7048931e2c3ad8b3d9f","amp;dn":"J.D.+Robb+-+Kindred+in+Death+%28Retail%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a98ce56f26aa633f9654d7048931e2c3ad8b3d9f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,140,229,111,38,170,99,63,150,84,215,4,137,49,226,195,173,139,61,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
