The island are in different oceans and conditions, and whether isolated or not, wildlife, human populations and even geology often interact(ed) significantly with insular and/or continental neighbors.\n\nEpisode Description:\n\nOn the Zanzibar islands, off the Indian Ocean coast of Tanganyka, mild predation and relatively easy feeding contributed to the development of giant species, as of crabs and bats. Only Pemba, the second largest island, is a regular la,d mass, the others were coral reefs until the sea-level fell.
