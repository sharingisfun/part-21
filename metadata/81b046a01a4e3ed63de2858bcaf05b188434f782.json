Then he does go somewhere - where, he isn't sure, but it is a fantasy setting much like the game, though nothing looks familiar. He saves a princess and her followers upon his arrival from the sky, when he lands squarely upon the leader of the group threatening them. He ends up joining the princess's group as he searches for a way back to his own world.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81b046a01a4e3ed63de2858bcaf05b188434f782","amp;dn":"Ixion+Saga+DT+%5BCommie%5D+Batch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81b046a01a4e3ed63de2858bcaf05b188434f782","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,176,70,160,26,78,62,214,61,226,133,139,202,240,91,24,132,52,247,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
