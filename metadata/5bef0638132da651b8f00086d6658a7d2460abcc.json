He was influenced by the work of Desiderius Erasmus, who made the Greek New Testament available in Europe, and Martin Luther. Tyndale was the first to translate considerable parts of the Bible from the original languages (Greek and Hebrew) into English, for a public, lay readership. While a number of partial and complete translations had been made from the seventh century onward, particularly during the 14th century, Tyndale\\'s was the first English translation to draw directly from Hebrew and Greek texts, and the first to take advantage of the new medium of print, which allowed for its wide distribution. This was taken to be a direct challenge to the hegemony of both the Roman Catholic Church and the English church and state. Tyndale also wrote, in 1530, The Practyse of Prelates, opposing Henry VIII\\'s divorce on the grounds that it contravened scriptural law.\n\nIn 1535, Tyndale was arrested by church authorities and jailed in the castle of Vilvoorde outside Brussels for over a year. He was tried for heresy, strangled and burnt at the stake in 1536. The Tyndale Bible, as it was known, continued to play a key role in spreading Reformation ideas across Europe. The fifty-four independent scholars who created the King James Version of the bible in 1611 drew significantly on Tyndale\\'s translations. One estimation suggests the New Testament in the King James Version is 83% Tyndale\\'s, and the Old Testament 76%.\n\n\nImpact on the English language\n\nIn translating the Bible, Tyndale introduced new words into the English language, and many were subsequently used in the King James Bible:\n\nJehovah (from a transliterated Hebrew construction in the Old Testament; composed from the Tetragrammaton YHWH.\nPassover (as the name for the Jewish holiday, Pesach or Pesah)\nscapegoat (the goat that bears the sins and iniquities of the people in Leviticus, Chapter 16)Coinage of the word atonement (a concatenation of the words \\'At One\\' to describe Christ\\'s work of restoring a good relationshipÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a reconciliationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½between God and people) is also sometimes ascribed to Tyndale. However, the word was probably in use by at least 1513, before Tyndale\\'s translation. Similarly, sometimes Tyndale is said to have coined the term mercy seat. While it is true that Tyndale introduced the word into English, mercy seat is more accurately a translation of Martin Luther\\'s German Gnadenstuhl.\nAs well as individual words, Tyndale also coined such familiar phrases as:\nlead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil\nknock and it shall be opened unto you\ntwinkling of an eye (another translation from Luther)\na moment in time\nfashion not yourselves to the world\nseek and you shall find\nask and it shall be given you\njudge not that you not be judged\nthe word of God which liveth and lasteth forever\nlet there be light (Luther translated Genesis 1,3 as: Es werde Licht, which would be word for word translated: It will be light)\nthe powers that be\nmy brother\\'s keeper\nthe salt of the earth\na law unto themselves\nfilthy lucre\nit came to pass\ngave up the ghost\nthe signs of the times\nthe spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak (which is like Luther\\'s translation of Mathew 26,41: der Geist ist willig, aber das Fleisch ist schwach; Wyclif for example translated it with: for the spirit is ready, but the flesh is sick.)\nlive and move and have our being\nfight the good fight\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5bef0638132da651b8f00086d6658a7d2460abcc","amp;dn":"God%5C%27s+Outlaw+-+William+Tyndale+Bio+%281st+Successful+English+Bibl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5bef0638132da651b8f00086d6658a7d2460abcc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,239,6,56,19,45,166,81,184,240,0,134,214,101,138,125,36,96,171,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
