This UNDUB has\n  the USA english text with the original Japanese spoken dialog.\n  \n  Enjoy this game the way it was meant to be played!\n\n                    -- Release Notes --  \n  \n  THIS IS A BETA RELEASE.  It may be very broken.  I am only\n  releasing it because it may also be fine, and I feel bad that\n  anybody has to endure Milla's ghastly english voice...\n  \n  The mute event scene issue seems to be resolved but I am not\n  very comfortable with fix.  It may show up again later.  Since\n  I've finished both TOX1 and TOX2, I'm pretty sick of the game\n  and not planning to play it again to find out.\n  \n  If you find major problems, post a save somewhere I might find.\n  \n  Movie, event, battle and skit voices are now in Japanese.\n  \n  Hackers/coders want to contact me?  Look for a fluffy kitty.\n  \n                   *** USA PUBLISHERS ***\n  \n  Please stop ruining your games with such horrible english dubs!\n  We are forced to go to extremes like this because you are making\n  the games we love unplayable!\n  \n  Seriously, your customers expect dual-audio releases.  It's 2013\n  and you're still not selling what we want.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:11db28a8191fa5409960f0efc844a34ffd7554cc","amp;dn":"Tales+of+Xillia+UNDUB+BETA1+READNFO+PS3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"11db28a8191fa5409960f0efc844a34ffd7554cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,219,40,168,25,31,165,64,153,96,240,239,200,68,163,79,253,117,84,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
