Like his old St. Louis pals, Henneman has fashioned a rough-and-tumble brand of hillbilly music with loud drums and modern storytelling. Henneman, who wrote or cowrote 11 of the album's 13 songs, owns a great rock &amp; roll voice that can growl when it wants to and articulate nuances when it needs to. This is an impressive debut album that introduces a major singer-songwriter.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc8acca0ee03e3020c6cd76c314dba6b73941900","amp;dn":"The+Bottle+Rockets+-+Bottle+Rockets+%5B1993%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc8acca0ee03e3020c6cd76c314dba6b73941900","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,138,204,160,238,3,227,2,12,108,215,108,49,77,186,107,115,148,25,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
