Using anecdotes, self-reflection, guest essays, and thorough research, Dotson explains what OCD is and how readers with OCD can begin to get better. The essays in the book by teens with OCD provide additional perspectives of OCD so all readers can see themselves reflected in the book. The eBook format makes content readily accessible for teens seeking information on a sensitive and personal topic. With humor, specific advice, and an inspiring, been-there-beat-that attitude, readers will find the book simultaneously touching and practical.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d41d4ebc132a740f5fd2977404ed7203eaa99ff","amp;dn":"Being+Me+With+OCD+-+How+I+Learned+to+Obsess+Less+and+Live+My+Lif","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d41d4ebc132a740f5fd2977404ed7203eaa99ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,65,212,235,193,50,167,64,245,253,41,119,64,78,215,32,62,170,153,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
