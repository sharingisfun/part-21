However, this is the botched DVD version that runs short and is missing Jessica while Blue Sky is overdubbed with interviews and Elizabeth Reed is edited. What can I say .. they made a mess. If you can find the VHS version .. get it! Still, sound and picture is great. This video is 55minutes total (VHS is roughly 90 min).\n\nIf I could find the VHS version in my vault and knew how to rip it I would .. one day maybe ;-)\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8cccfa74d87ce959863d6e1c8edbbef0e7519409","amp;dn":"The+Allman+Brothers+at+Great+Woods+1991","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8cccfa74d87ce959863d6e1c8edbbef0e7519409","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,204,250,116,216,124,233,89,134,61,110,28,142,219,190,240,231,81,148,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
