Pianist Ray Bryant uplifts such pop material as &quot;Let It Be,&quot; &quot;Bridge Over Troubled Waters,&quot; &quot;Hey Jude,&quot; and &quot;Spinning Wheel.&quot; Four selections find Bryant's trio (with electric bassist Chuck Rainey and drummer Jimmy Johnson) augmented by either horns (on &quot;Let It Be&quot;) or by strings effectively arranged by Eumir Deodata. The colorful results are not essential but are less dated than one might think. (Allmusic)\nIt looks like the review on AllMusic is before 2012\n\nTrack list:\n01 - Stick with It\n02 - Let It Be\n03 - Bridge over Troubled Water\n04 - Hey Jude\n05 - Shake-A-Lady\n06 - Unchained Melody\n07 - My Cherie Amour\n08 - Spinning Wheel\n\nEnjoy and share!
