Track information and cover art may therefore not be available for all of them. I went and checked at Amazon.com for each one to verify that they were out of print; some are available used, one was listed for SIXTY DOLLARS (!) and some simply didn&amp;#039;t exist. These are lost treasures. Keep them well for me.\n\nTo save time and space, I ripped these at 320 kb rather than in Windows Lossless. As before, there are five torrents in total. This one includes:\n\nDanse Royale (Ensemble Alcatraz) &lt;-- the first period CD I ever purchased\nVisions &amp; Miracles (Ensemble Alcatraz)\nLe Jeu des PÃƒÂ¨lerins d&amp;#039;EmmaÃƒÂ¼s (Ensemble Organum)\nGuiraut Riquier- 9 Suites Medievales (La Compagnie Medievale)\nJaufre Rudel- 12th siecle Troubadour (La Compagnie Medievale)\n\nBe certain to download my other torrents of medieval and archaic music! Appeciative comments are always appreciated in turn. Enjoy -- and keep seeding!\n\n-- Rivenshield","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:863785c949f8547e207ae5acad41e67ceb584802","amp;dn":"Music+of+the+Middle+Ages+6","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"863785c949f8547e207ae5acad41e67ceb584802","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,55,133,201,73,248,84,126,32,122,229,172,173,65,230,124,235,88,72,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
