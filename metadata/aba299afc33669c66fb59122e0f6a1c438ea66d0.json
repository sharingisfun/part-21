The bin and cue files were generated by PowerISO 4.4.\n\nThis is the 1999 Japanese reissue of Wings Over America.\n\nThe discs were ripped securely through EAC, and converted into FLAC files through EAC. \n\nThe files were then converted to wav files then Adobe was used to create the 6 channels. \n\nFinally, SurCode was used to encode to DTS surround sound.\n\nPlease note: The artwork that is included here is not from the Japanese 3 album set but from the 2 CD disc set. I did not have any artwork from the Japanese set, but the two discs encoded to 5.1 DTS follow the list from the two cd set.\n\nI checked this out on my surround system and all 6 speakers are active.\n\nPlease leave a comment after you listen to this and let me know what you think. This is my third cd conversion to 5.1 DTS surround cd. I solicit constructive criticism, but please don't flame. \n\nThis sounds great crancked up on my surround stereo so I thought I would share this with others. \n\nYou can find Paul McCartney - Flowers In The Dirt 5.1 DTS Upmix here:\nor here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4910474&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4910474&lt;/a&gt;\n\nYou can find Paul McCartney - Off The Ground 5.1 DTS Upmix here:\nor here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4910484&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4910484&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEnjoy.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aba299afc33669c66fb59122e0f6a1c438ea66d0","amp;dn":"Paul+McCartney+%28Beatles%29+-+Wings+Over+America+5.1+DTS+Upmix","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aba299afc33669c66fb59122e0f6a1c438ea66d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,162,153,175,195,54,105,198,111,181,145,34,224,246,161,196,56,234,102,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
