The Eastern, or Byzantine, Empire, endured until the capture of Constantinople by the Ottoman Turks, in 1453. Historian OÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Donnell presents a more nuanced and probably more accurate view in an engrossing and wonderfully descriptive portrait of late antiquity. OÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢DonnellÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s focus is the sixth century, when the reimposition of imperial control over lost territory in Italy and the west was still feasible. As OÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Donnell illustrates, the city of Rome had long ceased to be the center of the empire; commercial hubs such as Alexandria and other prosperous eastern cities were more influential. It was the failure of the elites of this civilization, particularly the emperor Justinian, that made the loss of western territories irrevocable. As he explores his thesis, OÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Donnell provides a sweeping panorama that includes diverse Christian sects, surprisingly civilized barbarians, and ordinary humans striving to survive in an unstable world.\n\n===================================================================================\n***********************************************************************************\n**********In order to keep files alive please seed until a ratio of 1:1************\n****************************Thank you ~ Oceanhawk :)*******************************\n***********************************************************************************\n===================================================================================\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f64e1511186ad110a24f9441acd296ba0e25ea59","amp;dn":"The+Ruin+of+the+Roman+Empire+-+Oceanhawk","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f64e1511186ad110a24f9441acd296ba0e25ea59","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,78,21,17,24,106,209,16,162,79,148,65,172,210,150,186,14,37,234,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
