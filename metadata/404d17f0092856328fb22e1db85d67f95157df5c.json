SpeedFan automatically searches your computer \nfor informative chips: the hardware monitor chips. SpeedFan can display voltages, \nfan speeds and temperatures. On rare occasions, the BIOS doesn't activate such features. \nSpeedFan tries to enable them as long as this is a safe thing to do. \nNot only the motherboard is searched, but also some video cards and \nalmost every currently sold hard disk. SpeedFan can access status info from EIDE, \nSATA and even SCSI drives, consistently showing internal data that can be \nused to diagnose current and future hard disk failures. \nThis is known as S.M.A.R.T. (Self-Monitoring Analysis and Reporting Technology). \nAt the lowest level, the SpeedFan hardware monitor software can access \ndigital temperature sensors, but its main feature is its ability to control fan speeds \naccording to the temperatures inside your PC, thus reducing noise. \n\nplz seed after downloading..\n\ndont forget to post you comments.!!!\n\ncheck my other releases at&quot;http://thepiratebay.se/user/594mgnav/&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:404d17f0092856328fb22e1db85d67f95157df5c","amp;dn":"Speed+Fan+4.46+beta2+%5BVERIFIED%5D+By+Team+Nanban","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"404d17f0092856328fb22e1db85d67f95157df5c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,77,23,240,9,40,86,50,143,178,46,29,184,93,103,249,81,87,223,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
