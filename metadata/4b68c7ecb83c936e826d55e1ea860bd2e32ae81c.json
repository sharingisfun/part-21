The concert reflects that, looking forward to the upcoming â€œTinseltown Rebellionâ€ album to be issued in May 1981.\r\n\r\nThe technical abilities of Zappa's band allowed for the rhythmic complexity and sudden shifts from one song to another in which he delighted, as the group suddenly changed from rapid-fire improvisatory playing to subtle vamping behind one of his comic monologues.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrank Zappa\r\n\r\nBuffalo\r\n\r\n(Memorial Auditorium, Buffalo, New York, October 25, 1980)\r\n\r\n2007\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2CDs / 2007 / 320Kbps\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISC 1:\r\n\r\n1.\tChungaâ€™s Revenge 8:34\r\n2.\tYou Are What You Is 4:12\r\n3.\tMudd Club 3:02\r\n4.\tThe Meek Shall Inherit Nothing 3:21\r\n5.\tCosmik Debris 3:50\r\n6.\tKeep It Greasy 2:58\r\n7.\tTinsel Town Rebellion 4:19\r\n8.\tBuffalo Drowning Witch 2:44\r\n9.\tHoney, Donâ€™t You Want A Man Like Me? 4:36\r\n10.\tPick Me, Iâ€™m Clean 10:15\r\n11.\tDead Girls Of London 3:02\r\n12.\tShall We Take Ourselves Seriously? 1:36\r\n13.\tCity Of Tiny Lites 9:58\r\n\r\n\r\nDISC 2:\r\n\r\n1.\tEasy Meat 9:26\r\n2.\tAinâ€™t Got No Heart 2:00\r\n3.\tThe Torture Never Stops 23:36\r\n4.\tBroken Hearts Are For Assholes 3:39\r\n5.\tIâ€™m So Cute 1:38\r\n6.\tAndy 8:14\r\n7.\tJoeâ€™s Garage 2:12\r\n8.\tDancing Fool 3:36\r\n9.\tThe â€œReal Worldâ€ Thematic Extrapolations 8:53\r\n10.\tStick It Out 5:36\r\n11.\tI Donâ€™t Wanna Get Drafted 2:48\r\n12.\tBobby Brown 2:42\r\n13.\tMs Pinky 3:48\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrank Zappa\r\n\r\nBuffalo\r\n\r\n(Memorial Auditorium, Buffalo, New York, October 25, 1980)\r\n\r\n2007\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n:)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b68c7ecb83c936e826d55e1ea860bd2e32ae81c","amp;dn":"Frank+Zappa+-+Buffalo+%282007%29+2CD+%28Buffalo%2C+New+York%2C+1980%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b68c7ecb83c936e826d55e1ea860bd2e32ae81c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,104,199,236,184,60,147,110,130,109,85,225,234,134,11,210,227,42,232,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
