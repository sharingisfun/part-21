Three men in a Louisiana prison and with different, \n   but similar in some sense, personalities. \n\n   &quot;He has captured man's fear within himself, and, the ability to hide that \n   fear. It takes a director of great courage and knowledge of self to pull \n   that one off without boring you.\n     If you're a fan of Joel Schumaucher or James Cameron, this is not the \n   film for you. But if your a fan of people, and, the human condition, the \n   mirror reflects back, 2 hours at a time, and Jarmusch is right behind it.&quot;\n   - cgierl@IMDB\n                                                                                \n## Release info                                                                 \n############################################################################### \n#  \n   Name...........: Down by Law - Jim Jarmusch - Tom Waits, John Lurie &amp; \n                    Roberto Benigni\n   Ripper.........: Nirre\n   Release Date...: 2005-08-25\n   Region(s)......: 0\n   Source.........: DVD Retail\n   Type...........: DVD-R\n   Format.........: .iso\n   Size...........: 4.24 GB\n                                                                                \n   PAL/NTSC.......: PAL (720x576)\n   Screen format..: 16:9 Anamorphic\n   Audio Language.: English\n   Audio Format...: DD 2.0, mono\n   Subtitles......: None\n                    \n\n   Menus..........: [X] Untouched, intact.                                      \n                    [ ] Stripped                                                \n                                                                                \n   Video..........: [X] Untouched, intact.                                      \n                    [ ] Re-encoded                                              \n                                                                                \n   DVD-extras.....: [ ] Untouched, intact.                                      \n                    [ ] Stripped\n                    [ ] Re-encoded\n                    [X] None                                                   \n                                                                                \n## Ripper Notes                                                               \n############################################################################### \n#                                                                               \n   Great photo, plot and directing even though most people (including myself) \n   thought it slow, uninteresting the first time they see it.
