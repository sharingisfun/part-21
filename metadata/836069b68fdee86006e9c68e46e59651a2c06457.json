What Would You Give In Exchange For Your Soul\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTES : This is a re-rip of this box set ripped with EAC 1.0b3.\nEverytime I've ripped it, tracks 25 &amp; 26 on disc 7 always return \nwith suspicious positions and CRC mismatches. I've listened to \nthe songs and can hear no audible problems. There were 2 typos I \ncorrected : The song &quot;What Would You Give In Excange For Your Soul&quot; \nwas titled &quot;What Would You Give In Excange For My Soul.&quot; And the \nsong &quot;The Price Of The Bottle&quot; was titled &quot;The Price On The Bottle.&quot;\n \n________________________________________\n\nWhile the Bear Family label in Germany has accomplished many formidable feats -- four \nJohnny Cash box sets, six Hank Snow boxes, four Flatt &amp; Scruggs boxes, and on and on \n-- the accomplishment in putting together this eight-CD 219-track collection of Louvin \nBrothers recordings may be the label's finest hour. If there were ever a duo that \nembodied the entirety of the country tradition from its folk music and gospel roots \nthrough the development of bluegrass and into honky tonk music, it was the Louvins, who \nhave inspired virtually everyone who has come after them. Charlie and Ira took harmony \nsinging to a new level and the creation of full-length albums far out of the sphere of \none or two singles and filler. Whether it be in the duets of Porter Wagoner and Dolly \nParton, Gram Parsons and Emmylou Harris, or the alt-country band Freakwater, the Louvins \nare in the stem. Here are contained all of their Capitol, Decca, MGM, and Apollo sides. \nAll of the concept recordings, such as Satan Is Real, Tragic Songs of Life, and the rest, \nare here in chronological order, with complete session notes. In merely listing the \npersonnel, the reader will be awed at who performed with them: Owen Bradley, Pete Drake, \nDon Helms, Chet Atkins, Grandpa Jones, Dale Potter, Buddy Harman, Jimmy Capps, and the \nJordanaires, to name just a few. Fred Rose was their producer, along with Bradley. And \nthen the songs -- whether they be traditional Christmas songs like &quot;O Little Town of \nBethlehem,&quot; broken-hearted love songs such as &quot;I Hear You've Been Cheatin' on Me&quot; and \n&quot;Love Is a Lonely Street,&quot; patriotic anthems such as &quot;I Died for the Red, White and Blue,&quot; \nor gospel songs like &quot;Mother I Thank You for the Bible You Gave Me,&quot; the restless, \nlonesome ghostly sound of sweetness itself is present. It's true that this is mainly for \nthe fanatics, but it's also for libraries and historians of the music, and for those who \ncan't get enough of Gram and Emmylou or real country music. This set is a treasure. Period.\n\n-- Thom Jurek\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:836069b68fdee86006e9c68e46e59651a2c06457","amp;dn":"Louvin+Brothers+-+Close+Harmony++%5B8+disc+set%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"836069b68fdee86006e9c68e46e59651a2c06457","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,96,105,182,143,222,232,96,6,233,198,142,70,229,150,81,162,192,100,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
