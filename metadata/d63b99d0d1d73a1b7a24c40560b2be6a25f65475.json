Host of The Goddamn Show. As of this writing, I&amp;#039;m not on the air anymore due to family life, but I hope to be around for show specials, shit like that. Fuck you.\n\nIncluded in this torrent are three CDs, two of which were sold for money at one time (The Gumball Machine of Light and Scotch Induced Coma) and the third one (My) was going to be released, but I moved to New York because I knocked your mom up and got arrested for pooping on the floor. \n\nThese CDs are the product of impromptu imagination or whatever the christ you call it. Everything was recorded in one take. It&amp;#039;s not like the show &quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway&quot; where they record 77 hours of performances and then cut it down to 30 minutes to make it look good. Go to hell. Also keep in mind that the songs are in random order; as in, they aren&amp;#039;t in the same order as they appeared on the original CD (for the first 2 CDs, anyways). \n\nThe BONUS folder contains other songs I played on my show over time, and the UNRELEASED folder contains shit that never made it to the CDs. \n\nAlso, Mrs. Brubaker gave me permission to include her Skype calls. It&amp;#039;s every single one. Some of them just flat suck, so there. \n\nI hope you enjoy a little of what I had to offer. Feel free to share the collection with everyone you know. Just don&amp;#039;t make money off it. Asshole.\n\n10-4 motherfucker,\n\nSloan\n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;f7849b989699c5c6cfceb79f98839a969e9bd994989a&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d63b99d0d1d73a1b7a24c40560b2be6a25f65475","amp;dn":"Sloan+-+The+Goddamn+Show+-+Waiting+For+The+Martyr+Train+-+Comple","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d63b99d0d1d73a1b7a24c40560b2be6a25f65475","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,59,153,208,209,215,58,27,122,36,196,5,96,178,190,106,37,246,84,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
