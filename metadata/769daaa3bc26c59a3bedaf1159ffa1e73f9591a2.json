It is more of compilation video because each video in the package was recorded separately and then edited together, with the exception of Gave Up. The video was filmed and directed by Peter Christopherson of the band Coil, and Trent Reznor. \nThe whole video is about twenty minutes in length and features videos for almost all of the tracks from Broken (The exceptions being the short musical interlude Help Me I Am In Hell, and the track Last, which had no video). The wraparound story involves a young man being kidnapped and made to watch Nine Inch Nails videos while being tortured, which allegedly provoked an investigation by the FBI who thought that it was an actual snuff film. \n\nThe video for Happiness In Slavery was lifted from the compilation and used to promote the single of the same name. The video features performance artist Bob Flanagan strapping himself into a machine that subsequently rapes and kills him. The video was universally banned. The film also has a cameo by Robert Patrick (most famous for his role as the T2000 in the Hollywood blockbuster and brother of Filter frontman and former NIN guitarist Richard Patrick) portraying a police officer. \n\nThe video has not been given an official commercial release thus adding to its mythological status in alternative culture. The original hand-dubbed tapes were distributed my Reznor to various friends and dominatrixes, and original tapes are hard to come by. A future release seems unlikely, but it is available on some Nine Inch Nails fansites as well as on file sharing networks in Mpeg form. These are generally not of the highest quality as they are not first generation copies. \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nVarning: ganska vÃƒÂ¥ldsam video frÃƒÂ¥n NIN's bÃƒÂ¤sta era!\n\nDen omtalade aldrig slÃƒÂ¤ppta videon till Broken EP'n.\n\nTÃƒÂ¤nkte att jag slÃƒÂ¤pper denna eftersom NIN snart ÃƒÂ¤r aktuella med nya albumet With teeth. \n(Som troligtvis inte lÃƒÂ¤r ha en lika kontroversiell video med i paketet)  \n\nKvaliten ÃƒÂ¤r inte den bÃƒÂ¤sta, men som sagt - den hÃƒÂ¤r videon har aldrig slÃƒÂ¤ppts fÃƒÂ¶r allmÃƒÂ¤nheten. \n(Och den ÃƒÂ¤r ett mÃƒÂ¥ste om du ÃƒÂ¤r ett NIN fan)\n\n\n\nHÃƒÂ¥ll till godo! ;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:769daaa3bc26c59a3bedaf1159ffa1e73f9591a2","amp;dn":"Nine+Inch+Nails+-+Broken+%28the+banned+never+released+video%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"769daaa3bc26c59a3bedaf1159ffa1e73f9591a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,157,170,163,188,38,197,154,59,237,175,17,89,255,161,231,63,149,145,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
