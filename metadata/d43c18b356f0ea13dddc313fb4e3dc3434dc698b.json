Jackson Browne is\nnot alone in being impressed by this band,\nsince their emergence on the Norwegian rock scene\nin 2005 their albums and live performances\nhave gained rave reviews.\n\nEl Cuero's unique blend of rock based on an\nAmerican brew has been perfected to a T during\nthese years giving them a powerful, melodic and\nabove all bombastic groove. This will become ever\nmore evident with the 2011 release of their\nupcoming third album.\n\nEl Cuero's new album &quot;From Mountains To Sand&quot;, is\nmixed by David Bianco who's CV includes\nBob Dylan, AC/DC and Ozzy Osbourne among others.\nThis album is produced by Lars HÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥vard\nHaugen making it his second successful attempt at\ncapturing the band and honing their skills to\ntape. Their songwriting is better than ever and\nthe production team has created a monstrous hard\nhitting album with exquisite performances all\naround. This album has a really hot buzz going and\nthe band is dying to release it and hit the road.\n\nEl Cuero was started by two brothers, HÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥vard &amp;\nBrynjar Takle Ohr in 2005. After growing up\ntogether sharing bunk beds in the Norwegian town\nof Kristiansund, listening to music and developing\ntheir own musical skills, they finally put the\nband together that you are listening to today.\nWith Brynjar on guitar and lead vocals, HÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥vard on\ndrums, yvind BlomstrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¸m on guitar and Tommy Reite\non bass, the classic rock combo El Cuero saw the\nlight of day.\n\nTheir first outing in 2007 was the self-titled El\nCuero and gained rave reviews for their blend of\npowerful Crazy Horse influenced rock, via Steve\n&quot;Earlish&quot; compositions to beautiful acoustic music\nwith soaring harmonies.\n\nThey also quickly gained a reputation for being\none of Norway's best live bands.\nTheir second outing was called A Glimmer Of Hope\nand was the first album produced by Lars\nHÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥vard Haugen. Eden Parke of Uncut magazine summed\nup El Cuero by saying, They rock like\nbastards.  A Glimmer of Hope cemented their\nposition as being a favorite among both critics\nand audiences with excellent reviews.\n\nEl Cuero lineup:\nBrynjar Takle Ohr (gitar/vokal),\nHÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥vard Takle Ohr (trommer/vokal),\nTommy Reite (bass),\nyvind BlomstrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¸m (gitar/pedalsteel/vokal)\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.el-cuero.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.el-cuero.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nKLV is the foreign music division of KALEVALA\n\nwant us on your secure, non-rented, non-.de/.at/.ch\nsite full of nice ppl and no dickheads?\ntry to get a hold of us on irc...\n\ngreets fly out to everyone we met over the years and\nmany good grps like:\n\nBERC - GREiD - hUSHhUSH - mwnd - soup - SHELTER - FNT\nrH - GRW - DEF - BCC - DPS - AEROHOLiCS - SiNNERS\nSAiNTS - Razor1911 - gEm - ss - FiCO - WAGNER\nBLooDWeiSeR - UKi - FFNDVD - NGP - aAF\n\n.....:  - -- -------\\/--\\--_((_oX_))_--/--\\/------- -- -  :.....\n\n..:  ....:             aBHO  _ __\\/__ _   -T!             :....  :..","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d43c18b356f0ea13dddc313fb4e3dc3434dc698b","amp;dn":"El_Cuero-El_Cuero-2007-KLV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d43c18b356f0ea13dddc313fb4e3dc3434dc698b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,60,24,179,86,240,234,19,221,220,49,63,180,227,220,52,52,220,105,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
