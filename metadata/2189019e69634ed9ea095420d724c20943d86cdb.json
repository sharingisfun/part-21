In the years that followed he found himself adrift in a world of wealth, drugs, and fame, as well as dealing with the unexpected death of his abusive father. After a decade of decadence a chance for salvation arrives; the chance to reconnect with an actress he was once involved with, and their son. But almost immediately his new life is threatened by a freak sequence of events and a bizarre series of murders that all seem to connect to EllisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s past. His attempts to save his new world from his own demons makes Lunar Park EllisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most suspenseful novel. \n\nIn this chilling tale reality, memoir, and fantasy combine to create not only a fascinating version of this most controversial writer but also a deeply moving novel about love and loss, parents and children, and ultimately forgiveness.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2189019e69634ed9ea095420d724c20943d86cdb","amp;dn":"Lunar+Park","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2189019e69634ed9ea095420d724c20943d86cdb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,137,1,158,105,99,78,217,234,9,84,32,215,36,194,9,67,216,108,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
