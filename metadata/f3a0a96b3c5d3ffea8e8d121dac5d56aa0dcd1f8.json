G. Wodehouse, first published in the United Kingdom on October 15, 1954 by Herbert Jenkins, London and in the United States on February 23, 1955 by Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc., New York, under the title Bertie Wooster Sees It Through. \n\nWhen Bertie Wooster goes to stay with his Aunt Dahlia at Brinkley Court and finds himself engaged to the imperious Lady Florence Craye, disaster threatens from all sides.\n\nWhile Florence tries to cultivate his mind, her former fiancÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©, hefty ex-policeman \\&quot;Stilton\\&quot; Cheesewright, threatens to beat his body to a pulp, and her new admirer, the bleating poet Percy Gorringe, tries to borrow a thousand pounds. To cap it all, Bertie has incurred the disapproval of Jeeves by growing a moustache. Throw in a disappearing pearl necklace, Aunt Dahlia\\&amp;#039;s magazine \\&quot;Milady\\&amp;#039;s Boudoir,\\&quot; her cook Anatole, the Drones Club Darts match, and Mr. and Mrs. L.G. Trotter from Liverpool, and you have all the ingredients for a classic Wodehouse farce.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3a0a96b3c5d3ffea8e8d121dac5d56aa0dcd1f8","amp;dn":"P.G.+Wodehouse+-+Jeeves+and+the+Feudal+Spirit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f3a0a96b3c5d3ffea8e8d121dac5d56aa0dcd1f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,160,169,107,60,93,63,254,168,232,209,33,218,197,213,106,160,220,209,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
