AES-256 is a FIPS-approved symmetric encryption algorithm that may be used by U.S. Government organizations (and others) to protect sensitive information.\n\nDRIVECRYPT securely and easily protects all proprietary data on notebooks and desktop computers 100% of the time without users having to think about security. Any organization, from a small company to a large international firm with thousands of users in the field, can effectively protect business plans, client lists, product specifications, confidential corporate memos, stock information, and much more with this disk encryption product.\n\nHow DriveCrypt`s On-the-fly Encryption Works\n\nAs data is read from the hard disk, DRIVECRYPT automatically decrypts the data before it is loaded into memory. When data is written back to the hard disk, it is automatically re-encrypted. The disk encryption/ decryption process is completely transparent to the user or any application program -the data is caught &quot;on the fly&quot; as it transfers back and forth between the hard disk and memory. Consequently, users don't need to remember to decrypt or re-encrypt their data, or change the normal operation of the PC. In addition, only individual files are decrypted at any one time, not the whole hard disk.\n\n1. Strong Cryptography\n\n1344 Bit Military Strength disk encryption using the best and most proven cryptographic algorithms such as AES, Blowfish, Tea 16, Tea 32, Des, Triple Des, Misty 1 and Square.\n\n2. Easy to Install, Deploy &amp; Use\n\nDRIVECRYPT data encryption software requires minimal administration and user training. Disk encryption is completely transparent, requiring no change in the way users work with the computer.\n\n3. Maximize Your Security, Minimize Your Risk\n\nDRIVECRYPT protects your data with very fast and a true &quot;on the fly&quot; disk encryption process. Other products that claim to be &quot;on the fly&quot; decrypt an entire file and load it into memory, creating significant security risks. DriveCrypt file encryption software is smarter and more secure because it decrypts only the specific portion of a file that is in use.Unprotected data never resides on a DriveCrypt encrypted hard drive.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d87ed9c72c5558374d8eae291b38421712f9f4c","amp;dn":"SecurStar+DriveCrypt+Plus+Pack+v3.95%2BCrack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d87ed9c72c5558374d8eae291b38421712f9f4c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,135,237,156,114,197,85,131,116,216,234,226,145,179,132,33,113,47,159,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
