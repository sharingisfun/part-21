In this inspiring new book, best-selling author Abigail Trafford describes how people over fifty are rewriting the script of love and in the process redefining the institution of marriage for future generations.\nDrawing on interviews with hundreds of men and women, married and single, gay and straight, she shows how the unprecedented period of vitality after midlife but before traditional old age is much more complicated romantically and sexually than those glossy images of gray-haired people on the beach would suggest. And she reveals how todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s fifty-plus men and women are raising the bar on marital satisfaction. They are more likely to break up an unhappy liaison than previous generations; and they are more freewheeling in finding new formulas for romantic satisfaction............................\n\n[/color][/code][/b]\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7103c55770d1c1dbda8a88af985884915fceb98a","amp;dn":"As+Time+Goes+By-Mantesh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7103c55770d1c1dbda8a88af985884915fceb98a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,3,197,87,112,209,193,219,218,138,136,175,152,88,132,145,95,206,185,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
