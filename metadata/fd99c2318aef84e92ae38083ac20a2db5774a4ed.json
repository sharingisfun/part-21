Ron Covell shows dozens of ways to work with tubing, including bending with heat, bending with both inexpensive and high-end tube bending machines, mitering, flaring, and tapering tubing. There is an extensive section that deals with using U-bends, showing how to create anything from simple water pipes to elaborate headers. Most of the techniques use only simple shop equipment! You?ll love it!  \n\n95 minutes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd99c2318aef84e92ae38083ac20a2db5774a4ed","amp;dn":"Covell+Working+with+Tubing+%28imburne%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd99c2318aef84e92ae38083ac20a2db5774a4ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,153,194,49,138,239,132,233,42,227,128,131,172,32,162,219,87,116,164,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
