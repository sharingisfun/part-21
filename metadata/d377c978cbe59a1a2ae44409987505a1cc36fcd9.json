He freed the slaves, gave the world some of its most beautiful phrases, and redefined the meaning of America. He did all of this with wisdom, compassion, and wit.\n\nYet, throughout his life, Lincoln fought with God. In his early years in Illinois, he rejected even the existence of God and became the village atheist. In time, this changed but still he wrestled with the truth of the Bible, preachers, doctrines, the will of God, the providence of God, and then, finally, GodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s purposes in the Civil War. Still, on the day he was shot, Lincoln said he longed to go to Jerusalem to walk in the SaviorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s steps.\n\nWhat had happened? What was the journey that took Abraham Lincoln from outspoken atheist to a man who yearned to walk in the footsteps of Christ?\n\nIn this thrilling journey through a largely unknown part of American history, New York Times best-selling author Stephen Mansfield tells the richly textured story of Abraham LincolnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s spiritual life and draws from it a meaning sure to inspire Americans today.\n\nMeet the Author\nStephen Mansfield is a New York Times best-selling author and a popular speaker who is becoming one of the nationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most respected voices on religion in American culture. He is the author of The Faith of George W. Bush, The Faith of the American Soldier, Then Darkness Fled: The Liberating Wisdom of Booker T. Washington, and Never Give In: The Extraordinary Character of Winston Churchill, among other works of history and biography. In 2008, Mansfield wrote The Faith of Barack Obama, which was an international bestseller and was celebrated in reviews as an objective look at ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s religious life and the controversies that surrounded it.\n\nFounder of both The Mansfield Group, a research and communications firm, and Chartwell Literary Group, which creates and manages literary projects, Stephen is also in wide demand as a lecturer and inspirational speaker.\n\nNote from the OP - I'm calling total &quot;bullshit&quot; on the premise and the so-called scholarship of this book. I teach history. This is a self-serving and warped presentation designed to meet the author's wish that Lincoln had been the Christian that author Mansfield wanted him to be. I'm upping the torrent anyway - make up your own mind.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d377c978cbe59a1a2ae44409987505a1cc36fcd9","amp;dn":"Stephen+Mansfield+-+Lincoln%27s+Battle+with+God+%5B96%5D+Unabridged","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d377c978cbe59a1a2ae44409987505a1cc36fcd9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,119,201,120,203,229,154,26,42,228,68,9,152,117,5,161,204,54,252,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
