It helps you to get the most out of your hardware and your programmers simultaneously, saving both development and deployment costs.\n\nThis practical guide will walk you through getting the work done with D, from writing your first program to writing advanced autogenerated objects, with notes based on real-world experiences telling you about potential pitfalls and how to avoid them. You'll use some of the third-party libraries available for D to get code working fast, including access to database engines, image processing, and more.\n\nWhat you will learn from this book\n\n*Use the D programming language from &quot;Hello World&quot; to bare metal code\n\n*Gain an insight into avoiding the garbage collector and understand its pros and cons in real-world code examples\n\n*Discover how to use D's abstraction abilities to make the most of its effi cient and easy resource management capabilities\n\n*Implement and use ranges, a D idiom for lazy sequence implementation with decoupled generic algorithms\n\n*Explore a variety of third-party libraries available to get your work done faster\n\n*Integrate D into existing C, C++, and other environments\n\n*Prove program correctness with static analysis and test-driven development\n\t\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:39a95cfe3e7b006fe8eee1f6f8650468d6ad3a2e","amp;dn":"D+Cookbook+%28reupload%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"39a95cfe3e7b006fe8eee1f6f8650468d6ad3a2e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,169,92,254,62,123,0,111,232,238,225,246,248,101,4,104,214,173,58,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
