For solace, she drops in late at night a few times at Jeremy's diner for blueberry pie a la mode; they talk. Once, he watchers her sleep, her head on the counter. Abruptly, she leaves New York City to get away from her pain. She works a couple of jobs in Memphis. There, a heart-broken cop is drinking himself into oblivion, his ex occasionally showing up where he drinks and Lizzy works. Then, she's in Nevada, working at a casino where she uses her savings (she wants a car) to stake Leslie, a busted gambler, in a high rollers' game. After, Beth drives Leslie to Vegas where Leslie's estranged father lives. Broken relationships. What about Jeremy?\n\nPlease seed after downloading...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:879984c185369158dc829050ecf8ce22e1c5325a","amp;dn":"My+Blueberry+Nights+DvDrip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"879984c185369158dc829050ecf8ce22e1c5325a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,153,132,193,133,54,145,88,220,130,144,80,236,248,206,34,225,197,50,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
