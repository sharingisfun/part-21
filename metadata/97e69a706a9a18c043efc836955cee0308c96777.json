He is also the current second guitarist with South Carolina group Band of Horses.\n\nIn November 2007, Stereogum singled him out for their &quot;Artist to Watch&quot; series, describing his sound as reminiscent of both Ryan Adams and Red House Painters. Summing up his musical style, the Blog stated &quot;He's sad, but more outwardly expressive: There's a ragged blues to Ramsey's voice as well as his guitar playing.&quot;\n\n\n\nAssociation with Band of Horses:\n\nBill Reynolds, bassist for Band of Horses, invited Ramsey to visit him and the rest of the band in South Carolina. Tyler quickly hit it off with lead singer Ben Bridwell, who asked him to open for the band on their fall tour and come on board as their new guitar player. Commenting on the opportunity to play both his solo material and with Band of Horses, Ramsey said: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThis is going to be an amazing tour. To have the opportunity to play solo, as well as with such a great band, I really couldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t ask for more.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n\n01. Long Dream\n02. Ships\n03.
