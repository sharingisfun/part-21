As the stark black and white of Forsman's cartooning indicates, however, this is not a psychedelic, Kandy-Kolored Tangerine-Flake Streamline Baby kind of trip. Instead of the escapism they crave from their fragile home lives, the LSD only heightens their sense of ennui, exacerbates their fears about the world they're about to enter as adults, and creates doubts about everything they think they know. Though not entirely what they bargained for, will Mike and Wolf look back on their adventure as part of the 'celebrated summer' of their never-to-berecaptured youth, or a carelessly wasted part of the best years of their lives? Or both?\n\nFor anyone who cares, here's my release thread, I'll be posting all of my torrents there:   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/Thread-dfblast-s-Hipster-Comics&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/Thread-dfblast-s-Hipster-Comics&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c52fab770bd20f8eb44c085c62bdc45317485bf0","amp;dn":"Celebrated+Summer+%282013%29+%28digital-Empire%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c52fab770bd20f8eb44c085c62bdc45317485bf0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,47,171,119,11,210,15,142,180,76,8,92,98,189,196,83,23,72,91,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
