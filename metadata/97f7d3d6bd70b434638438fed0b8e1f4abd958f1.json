These carriers are: phonon (lattice vibration wave also treated as quasi-particle), electron (as classical or quantum entity), fluid particle (classical particle with quantum features), and photon (classical electromagnetic wave also as quasi-particle). The approach combines the fundamentals of the following fields: molecular orbitals-potentials, statistical thermodynamics, computational molecular dynamics, quantum energy states, transport theories, solid-state and fluid-state physics, and quantum optics. These are rationally connected to atomic-level heat transfer and thermal energy conversion. This textbook presents a unified theory, over fine-structure/molecular-dynamics/Boltzmann/macroscopic length and time scales, of heat transfer kinetics in terms of transition rates and relaxation times, and modern applications, including nano- and microscale size effects. Numerous examples, illustrations, and homework problems with answers enhance learning","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97f7d3d6bd70b434638438fed0b8e1f4abd958f1","amp;dn":"Heat+Transfer+Physics+-+Massoud+Kaviany","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97f7d3d6bd70b434638438fed0b8e1f4abd958f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,247,211,214,189,112,180,52,99,132,56,254,208,184,225,244,171,217,88,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
