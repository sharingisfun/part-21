A quest faces them both. Born in India, Kim is nevertheless white, a sahib. While he wants to play the Great Game of Imperialism, he is also spiritually bound to the lama. His aim, as he moves chameleon-like through the two cultures, is to reconcile these opposing strands, while the lama searches for redemption from the Wheel of Life.\n\nA celebration of their friendship in a beautiful but often hostile environment, 'Kim' captures the opulence of India's exotic landscape, overlaid by the uneasy presence of the British Raj.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6bb2e7464a5c8e60488f4ad529ece87abde2b928","amp;dn":"Kim+-+Rudyard+Kipling.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6bb2e7464a5c8e60488f4ad529ece87abde2b928","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,178,231,70,74,92,142,96,72,143,74,213,41,236,232,122,189,226,185,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
