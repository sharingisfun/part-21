Skilled in the North Mississippi Hill Country blues style popularized by his mentor R. L. Burnside, Brown began his career by apprenticing with Mississippi Joe Callicott, Johnny Woods, and Mississippi Fred McDowell. He has also cited Muddy Waters, Mojo Bufford, Jessie Mae Hemphill, Junior Kimbrough, Johnny Winter, and Johnny Shines as influences. He records for the Fat Possum Records label.\nIn 1971 Brown began performing with R. L. Burnside, who claimed Brown as his &quot;adopted son.&quot; and affectionately called him &quot;white boy on guitar&quot; and &quot;my white son.&quot; Both Brown and Burnside have noted the singularity of Brown's being a white musician playing in the previously predominantly African American genre of North Mississippi Hill Country blues.\nBrown's guitar work was featured in the 2006 film Black Snake Moan, where he provided backing for star Samuel L. Jackson's vocals. He can also be seen in the film's climax as a guitarist in a blues band, playing alongside Burnside's grandson Cedric.\nHe has also performed with rock bands Widespread Panic and the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion. \nBrown currently lives in Potts Camp, Mississippi, in the North Mississippi Hill Country.\n\nTracklist\n1.Jumper on The Line \n2.In the Mood \n3.Goin' back to Mississippi \n4.Frankie ; Albert \n5.Talk about Me \n6.Grease Monkey \n7.Hold Me Baby \n8.Wretched Mind \n9.From Now On \n10.Im a Lover\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b6b79deb28be96a1053717b297bd8c3151dd2692","amp;dn":"Kenny+Brown+Goin%5C%27+Back+To+Mississippi%28blues%29%28mp3%40320%29%5Brogercc%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b6b79deb28be96a1053717b297bd8c3151dd2692","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,183,157,235,40,190,150,161,5,55,23,178,151,189,140,49,81,221,38,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
