Drops in temperature are recorded, and Steve feels someone touch him on his back when no one else is nearby. They then travel to Ashland, Mass. to a pub called Stone's Public House, formerly The Railroad House. Here, a little girl died after being hit by a train. Glasses have been known to fly off the shelves, lights turn themselves on, and a number of other occurrences have been documented. \n\nSe om det finns nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥got mer jag har lagt upp:\n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/carma4&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/carma4&lt;/a&gt;\n\n/carma4","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c78e108eaa780c4300c0f888e1c1b1196a603bb4","amp;dn":"Ghost.hunters.del03.avi-carma4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c78e108eaa780c4300c0f888e1c1b1196a603bb4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,142,16,142,170,120,12,67,0,192,248,136,225,193,177,25,106,96,59,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
