Who's done a great job compiling the bits and pieces of this TV broadcast.\n\n\n&quot;2 mins 11 secs of video grabs were used \nto fill in the missing video and chapter 7 has an extra 20 secs of video on the end of Lotus on Irish Streams \nit was used to find a better spot to end piano solo (in my opinion both of these work much better) the audio \nsyncing really only starts from 2 min 45 secs on the DVD very few will even notice the filler video/audio matching \nI'e seen many different copies of these 2 parts over the years and now synced to this audio and watching the DVD \nthis is the best version I've seen.....recommended upgrade ... I hope the complete concert gets an offical release &quot;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b3c73bb02a4f2b79336b1f0fa5ac705d51894c3","amp;dn":"Mahavishnu+Orchestra+Munich+1972","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b3c73bb02a4f2b79336b1f0fa5ac705d51894c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,60,115,187,2,164,242,183,147,54,177,240,250,90,199,5,213,24,148,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
