The files have a suffix of .m4v as they were ripped using Handbrake with an Apple TV standard so they can be played on any iPod, iPhone, iPad, Apple TV or in iTunes. They can also be played on any compliant player but you may need to change the suffix from .m4v to .mp4.\n\nFor whatever reason dark areas of the original DVD appear slightly red. I also notice this on broadcast episodes and I think this is induced in the production of the show, but is more noticeable on the DVD's. This is not a rip defect.\n\nThere are no subtitles or alternate languages.\n\nFull episode descriptions can be found at:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_NCIS_episodes&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_NCIS_episodes&lt;/a&gt;\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - \nNCIS is an American police procedural drama television series revolving around a fictional team of special agents from the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, which conducts criminal investigations involving the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps.\n\nSeason 5 is the &quot;short&quot; season due to the writers strike that shortened almost all TV show seasons in that year.\n\nDescribing season four of NCIS as &quot;the season of secrets,&quot; executive producer Shane Brennan suggests that season five (offered here with 18 episodes, including a two-part finale,) is &quot;the season of answers.&quot; For the most part, thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s true--but at seasonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s end, loyal viewers are likely to be thrown for a loop by the death of a major character and a startling set of changes bound to have a profound effect on the showÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s future. \n\nPicking up where the previous year left off, this new batch jumps right in with a continuation of Special Agent Jethro Gibbs (Mark Harmon) and companyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s pursuit of notorious international arms dealer La Grenouille (&quot;The Frog,&quot; played by Armand Assante), whom NCIS director Jenny Shepard (Lauren Holly) is particularly keen on taking down--a quest thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s complicated by the fact that the bad guy is a CIA asset, and by Agent Anthony DiNozzoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s (Michael Weatherly) love affair with La GrenouilleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s daughter. That storyline, barely touched on thereafter, is resolved in the 14th episode, &quot;Internal Affairs.&quot; Meanwhile, the NCIS crew is distracted by an array of other cases, most of them involving murder. Of particular interest are several episodes related to Iraq and the War on Terror: a Naval officer of Syrian descent whoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s suspected of being an Al Qaeda mole is murdered seconds after Gibbs talks him out of jumping off a building ledge; a Marine whoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s having a violent bout of post-traumatic stress after returning from the Mideast turns out to be far worse off than that; Medical Examiner Donald &quot;Ducky&quot; Mallard (David McCallum) refuses to conduct an autopsy because of the deceasedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Muslim beliefs.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0430c5036b66e0fcf74d94150662cadc51abdb4b","amp;dn":"NCIS+Complete+Season+5+DVD+Rip+%28H.264+.m4v%2F.mp4%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0430c5036b66e0fcf74d94150662cadc51abdb4b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,48,197,3,107,102,224,252,247,77,148,21,6,98,202,220,81,171,219,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
