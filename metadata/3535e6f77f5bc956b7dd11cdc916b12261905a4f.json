Enlisting 250,000 workers in just two months, the CCC was an ambitious undertaking that brought several government agencies together in the effort. The Department of Labor recruited men from the ages of 18 to 25; the War Department clothed and trained them for two weeks, and the Department of Agriculture designed and managed the specific work assignments.\n\nWith projects in every U.S. state and territory, Ã¢â‚¬Å“RooseveltÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Tree ArmyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ lived in camps under quasi-military discipline, and received a wage of $30 per month, $25 of which they were required to send home to their families. Typically, boys rose early for breakfast in the canteen before heading off for eight hours of manual labor. Lunch was often brought out to the work site. In the evenings ninety percent of enrollees took advantage of classes offered in subjects from literature to welding Ã¢â‚¬â€ courses which, over nine years, taught 40,000 illiterate men to read and write.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3535e6f77f5bc956b7dd11cdc916b12261905a4f","amp;dn":"American+Experience+-+Civilian+Conservation+Corps+%5B.x264%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3535e6f77f5bc956b7dd11cdc916b12261905a4f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,53,230,247,127,91,201,86,183,221,17,205,201,22,177,34,97,144,90,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
