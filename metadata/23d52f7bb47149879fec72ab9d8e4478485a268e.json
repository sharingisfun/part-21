On This Is Fire, singer/guitarist Kathleen Baird's deep, haunting voice guides the listener through eight extended tracks flowing with off-kilter folk, twisted string-scapes, and a host of dark, otherworldly sounds that are as experimental as they are organic. This is creepy, intriguing stuff that takes a certain amount of effort; however, once SPTSR pulls you through the looking glass, you'll never want to return to the other side.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:23d52f7bb47149879fec72ab9d8e4478485a268e","amp;dn":"Spires+That+In+The+Sunset+Rise+-+This+Is+Fire+%5B2006%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"23d52f7bb47149879fec72ab9d8e4478485a268e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,213,47,123,180,113,73,135,159,236,114,171,157,142,68,120,72,90,38,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
