This book equips you with the information and practical advice needed to evaluate the many opportunities to take advantage of cloud computing. It features applications that empower you to use technology without the constraints of a locally supported infrastructure, and more in-depth information and examples of how to plunge directly into suitable projects by taking advantage of free services offered by the top cloud services providers. Examples include using cloud-based supplemental storage, Google s suite of apps, Amazon s S3 and EC2 services to power your library website, and DuraCloud to host an online library media collection.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18991ccd89fbc350f0a69307e5f6362affbc70ad","amp;dn":"Cloud+Computing+for+Libraries+%5BEPUB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18991ccd89fbc350f0a69307e5f6362affbc70ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,153,28,205,137,251,195,80,240,166,147,7,229,246,54,42,255,188,112,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
