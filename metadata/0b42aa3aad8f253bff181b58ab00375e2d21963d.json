Instead there was only a new star and a cloud of dust in our solar system. Over millions of years, a series of violent changes led to the formation of our world and, eventually, the creation of life.\nIn this photorealistic CGI epic, see how a boiling ball of rock transformed into the blue planet we know today. \n\n\n\nExplore every aspect of our world; learn how water first arrived on Earth, discover the vital role oxygen played as life forms began to evolve, and find out how land mammals evolved into dinosaurs and other giant beasts, before becoming extinct 65 million years ago.\nCutting-edge imagery also reveals how humans first began to walk on two feet and looks into the future to see what may be in store for our home over the next five billion years.\n\n\n\n\n\nNarrated by: Mark Strong\n========================\n\n\nProduced by: Yavar Abbas\n========================\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle................:    The Story Of Earth\nYear.................:    2011\nGenre................:    Documentary \nVideo Length.........:    01:30:00\n\n\nAudio Bitrate........:    256 kbit/s\nAudio Codec..........:    (AC3)\nLanguage.............:    English        \nDisplay Aspect ratio.:    4:3\n\nVideo Codec..........:    XviD \nVideo Resolution.....:    640x480\nVIdeo Bitrate........:    1460 kbit/s\n\n\nSubs.................:    (N/A) \nFile Size:...........:    939 MB\nFPS..................:    29.970000\n\nChannel(s)...........:    2 channels\nRelease date.........:    2011\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\n\nFor further information and pictures/images of all my torrents visit\\\\\\&quot; Suprbay Forum\\\\\\&quot; at \nthis link: &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&lt;/a&gt;                 \n\n*** This information is also avaible on the \\\\\\&quot;nfo\\\\\\&quot; file that comes with all my uploads.)***   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                     ***** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED DOWNLOAD *****\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b42aa3aad8f253bff181b58ab00375e2d21963d","amp;dn":"The+Story+Of+Earth-%28WTC-SWE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b42aa3aad8f253bff181b58ab00375e2d21963d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,66,170,58,173,143,37,59,255,24,27,88,171,0,55,94,45,33,150,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
