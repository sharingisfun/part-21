Armies of witch hunters battled the unnatural enemy across the globe for centuries, including KAULDER, a valiant warrior who managed to slay the all-powerful QUEEN WITCH, decimating her followers in the process. In the moments right before her death, the QUEEN curses KAULDER with her own immortality, forever separating him from his beloved wife and daughter in the afterlife. Today KAULDER is the only one of his kind remaining, and has spent centuries hunting down rogue witches, all the while yearning for his long-lost loved ones. However, unbeknownst to KAULDER, the QUEEN WITCH is resurrected and seeks revenge on her killer causing an epic battle that will determine the survival of the human race.\r\n\r\n\r\nenjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa852a2749f50eb8513c3a51e78a1ce4ea599f62","amp;dn":"The+Last+Witch+Hunter+HDTS.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa852a2749f50eb8513c3a51e78a1ce4ea599f62","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,133,42,39,73,245,14,184,81,60,58,81,231,138,28,228,234,89,159,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
