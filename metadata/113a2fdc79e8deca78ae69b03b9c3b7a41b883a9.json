Below us on every side mountain surged away it seemed forever; we looked down on glaciers and snow-covered peaks that perhaps no one has ever seen before, except from the air.'\n\nFeeling restless in the world of London's high-fashion industry, Eric Newby asked a friend to accompany him on a mountain-climbing expedition in the wild and remote Hindu Kush, in north-eastern Afghanistan. And so they went - although they did stop first for four days of climbing lessons in Wales - becoming the first Englishmen to visit this spectacular region for more than half a century. Newby's frank and funny account of their expedition to what is still amongst the world's most isolated areas is one of the classics of travel writing.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:113a2fdc79e8deca78ae69b03b9c3b7a41b883a9","amp;dn":"A+Short+Walk+in+the+Hindu+Kush","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"113a2fdc79e8deca78ae69b03b9c3b7a41b883a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,58,47,220,121,232,222,202,120,174,105,176,59,156,59,122,65,184,131,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
