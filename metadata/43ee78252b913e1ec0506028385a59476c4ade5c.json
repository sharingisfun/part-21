Stossel is an American consumer reporter, investigative journalist, author, libertarian columnist, and former co-anchor for the ABC News show 20/20. In this show he looks at consumer-focused topics, such as civil liberties, the business of health care, and free trade.\n\n_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2\n\nREAL SOCIAL JUSTICE\n\nFriday at 8PM ET on FBN\n\nWHAT IS Ã¢â‚¬ËœSOCIAL JUSTICE?' The left constantly praises &quot;social justice,&quot; but I don't know what it means. Hillary Clinton says: &quot;Spread those resources!&quot;\n\nIf I oppose that, am I for social injustice? To me, &quot;social justice&quot; means government stealing from some people to give to others, and bossing everyone around.\n\nWAL-MART: One of the social justice movement's biggest enemies is Wal-Mart, but most Americans are clueless about the benefits everybody gets from Wal-Mart.\n\nSLAVERY: Some people believe that slavery gave American capitalists a head start because they didn't have to pay for workers. But economist Don Boudreaux says the opposite is true... capitalism destroyed slavery.\n\nWITHOUT MARKETS: Once it became clear that Hugo Chavez's &quot;21st Century Socialism&quot; wasn't working, I thought American leftists would be embarrassed by their early enthusiasm... but no!\n\nSCIENCE &amp; REASON: Author Michael Shermer says it's odd that now some people complain that there's no social justice when &quot;we're living in the most moral period in human history.&quot;\n\nMY TAKE: Markets, in which individuals, not just rulers, have property rights, give people options. Businesses have an incentive to serve as many people as possible, regardless of gender or ethnic group. They also have an incentive to be nice --customers are more likely to trade with people who treat them fairly. Everyone gets to choose his own path. That's justice.\n\n_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2\n\nGeneral\nComplete name                            : Stossel.2015.06.05.Real.Social.Justice.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO.mp4\nFormat                                   : MPEG-4\nFormat profile                           : Base Media\nCodec ID                                 : isom\nFile size                                : 348 MiB\nDuration                                 : 41mn 5s\nOverall bit rate                         : 1 186 Kbps\nWriting application                      : Lavf56.25.101\n\nVideo\nID                                       : 1\nFormat                                   : AVC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                           : High@L3\nFormat settings, CABAC                   : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames                : 4 frames\nCodec ID                                 : avc1\nCodec ID/Info                            : Advanced Video Coding\nDuration                                 : 41mn 5s\nBit rate                                 : 1 047 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 624 pixels\nHeight                                   : 364 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 1.714\nFrame rate mode                          : Variable\nFrame rate                               : 29.970 fps\nMinimum frame rate                       : 9.990 fps\nMaximum frame rate                       : 29.970 fps\nColor space                              : YUV\nChroma subsampling                       : 4:2:0\nBit depth                                : 8 bits\nScan type                                : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)                       : 0.154\nStream size                              : 308 MiB (88%)\nWriting library                          : x264 core 142 r2389 956c8d8\nEncoding settings                        : cabac=1 / ref=3 / deblock=1:0:0 / analyse=0x3:0x133 / me=hex / subme=7 / psy=1 / psy_rd=1.00:0.00 / mixed_ref=1 / me_range=16 / chroma_me=1 / trellis=1 / 8x8dct=1 / cqm=0 / deadzone=21,11 / fast_pskip=1 / chroma_qp_offset=-2 / threads=6 / lookahead_threads=1 / sliced_threads=0 / nr=0 / decimate=1 / interlaced=0 / bluray_compat=0 / constrained_intra=0 / bframes=3 / b_pyramid=2 / b_adapt=1 / b_bias=0 / direct=1 / weightb=1 / open_gop=0 / weightp=2 / keyint=250 / keyint_min=25 / scenecut=40 / intra_refresh=0 / rc_lookahead=40 / rc=2pass / mbtree=1 / bitrate=1047 / ratetol=1.0 / qcomp=0.60 / qpmin=10 / qpmax=51 / qpstep=4 / cplxblur=20.0 / qblur=0.5 / ip_ratio=1.40 / aq=1:1.00\n\nAudio\nID                                       : 2\nFormat                                   : AAC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat profile                           : LC\nCodec ID                                 : 40\nDuration                                 : 41mn 5s\nBit rate mode                            : Constant\nBit rate                                 : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nChannel positions                        : Front: L R\nSampling rate                            : 48.0 KHz\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nStream size                              : 37.6 MiB (11%)\nLanguage                                 : unk","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43ee78252b913e1ec0506028385a59476c4ade5c","amp;dn":"Stossel.2015.06.05.Real.Social.Justice.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43ee78252b913e1ec0506028385a59476c4ade5c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,238,120,37,43,145,62,30,192,80,96,40,56,90,89,71,108,74,222,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
