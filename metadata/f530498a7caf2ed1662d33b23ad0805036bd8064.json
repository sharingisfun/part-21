She canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t wear heels, is terrified of heights and being a primary school teacher isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t exactly the job she dreamed of doing, especially when her class are stuck on the two times table.\n \nAt least Hope has Jack, and Jack is the God of boyfriends. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sweet, kind, funny, has a killer smile, a cool job on a fashion magazine and heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pretty (but in a manly way). Hope knew that Jack was The One ever since their first kiss after the Youth Club Disco and thirteen years later, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re still totally in love. Totally. And then Hope catches Jack kissing her best friend Susie Ã¢â‚¬Â¦\n \nDoes true love forgive and forget?\n\n Or does it get mad Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ and get even?\n\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f530498a7caf2ed1662d33b23ad0805036bd8064","amp;dn":"Sarra+Manning+-+Nine+Uses+For+An+Ex-Boyfriend%2CEpub%2C+Mobi%2C+KK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f530498a7caf2ed1662d33b23ad0805036bd8064","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,48,73,138,124,175,46,209,102,45,51,178,58,208,128,80,54,189,128,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
