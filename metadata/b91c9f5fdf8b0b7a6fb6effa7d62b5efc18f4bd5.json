The reason for the repack is because they had used the wrong audio. The quality is fine for a CAM, a little dark so might affect some parts, however, the audio is pretty nice. I saw this one on Boxing Day and I really enjoyed it, it was great fun. I donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t understand why theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re bashing the hell out of it though. The film was directed by Guy Ritchie.
