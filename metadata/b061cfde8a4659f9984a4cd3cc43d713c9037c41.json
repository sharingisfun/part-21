There are boysÃ¢â‚¬â€but every one of them vanishes at midnight on his eighteenth birthday. The ground shakes, the wind howls, a blinding light descendsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gone.\n\nThey call it the Heist.\n\nGray WeathersbyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s eighteenth birthday is mere months away, and heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s prepared to meet his fateÃ¢â‚¬â€œuntil he finds a strange note from his mother and starts to question everything heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been raised to accept: the Council leaders and their obvious secrets. The Heist itself. And what lies beyond the Wall that surrounds ClaysootÃ¢â‚¬â€œa structure that no one can cross and survive.\n\nClimbing the Wall is suicide, but what comes after the Heist could be worse. Should he sit back and wait to be takenÃ¢â‚¬â€œor risk everything on the hope of the other side?\n\n\nRating Details:\n\n3.77/5.0\n2,2471 Ratings\n456 Reviews\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b061cfde8a4659f9984a4cd3cc43d713c9037c41","amp;dn":"Taken+%28Erin+Bowman%29+%28FO12%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b061cfde8a4659f9984a4cd3cc43d713c9037c41","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,97,207,222,138,70,89,249,152,74,76,211,204,67,215,19,201,3,124,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
