I'm all for supporting the artist, but this is highway robbery. Each disc runs only 30 minutes so all 20 songs could easily be put onto a single disc. To make matters worse, the above website also sells a compilation disc with 18 tracks, which means that the only way to get all 20 songs is to buy the discs separately.\n\nThe above website also states that these recordings are from the &quot;master tapes&quot; but they sound to me like they were simply transferred from old LPs. \n\nIn addition, the discs themselves are not actually silver CDs but CDRs and the so-called artwork is nothing more than photocopies - and not good photocopies on decent paper either. \n\nFor the above reasons, I'm happy to share both albums in lossless FLAC format and hopefully save a few people $36!\n\n\nDavid Allan Coe\nUnderground Album\n\n101.
