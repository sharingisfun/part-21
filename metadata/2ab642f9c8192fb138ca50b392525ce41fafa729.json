This band is fronted by four animated members: 2D (lead vocals, keyboard, and melodica), Murdoc Niccals (bass guitar and drum machine), Noodle (guitar, keyboard, and backing vocals) and Russel Hobbs (drums and percussion). These members are completely fictional and are not personas of any &quot;real life&quot; musicians involved in the project. Their fictional universe is explored through the band's website and music videos, as well as a number of other media, such as short cartoons. The music is a collaboration between various musicians, with Albarn being the only permanent musical contributor. Their style is an amalgamation of genres, with influences including rock, alternative, trip hop,hip hop, electronica, dub, reggae and pop.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ab642f9c8192fb138ca50b392525ce41fafa729","amp;dn":"Gorillaz-Gorillaz+2001+..320kbps+%28stPaddy%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ab642f9c8192fb138ca50b392525ce41fafa729","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,182,66,249,200,25,47,177,56,202,80,179,146,82,92,228,31,175,167,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
