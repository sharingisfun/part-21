These technical articles discussed what was new or interesting in the design elements of new HP products.\n\nHP located plants next to major engineering universities. HP actively encouraged interchange between universities and the company. Another role served by the HP Journal was to provide a Ã¢â‚¬Å“publication vehicleÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ for academic-minded employees.\n\n\nThe Hewlett-Packard Journal was published in 50 volumes, from 1949 until 1998.\nThere were 479 issues published, if you count the &quot;Special Sputnik Supplement&quot; in \n1957. The HP Journal was initially published monthly (bi-monthly in the later part of its life). It is an outstanding source of information on the technology in HP products. Many of the articles also provide an insight into the design process used in the development of products.\n\n\nThe whole collection is also available on HPs home page as PDF downloads: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.hpl.hp.com/hpjournal/pdfs/IssuePDFs/hpjindex.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.hpl.hp.com/hpjournal/pdfs/IssuePDFs/hpjindex.html&lt;/a&gt;\nOR &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.hparchive.com/hp_journals.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.hparchive.com/hp_journals.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nYou can browse the collection offline using the &quot;hpjindex.html&quot; file in the &quot;HP journal&quot; folder after you download the torrent.
