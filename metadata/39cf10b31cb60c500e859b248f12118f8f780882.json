It has been with us since the beginning of history. The most widely-studied and catastrophic examples are, however, historically close: the Nazi Holocaust against the Jew, &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot; in Bosnia, and tribal warfare in Rwanda. Genocide is unfortunately a key feature of the study of world history at nearly every level. The Encyclopedia of Genocide and Crimes against Humanity spans the globe to explain the issues behind crimes against humanity and human rights issues as they relate to individual countries and the world at large. It traces the history of events that qualify as genocide and crimes against humanity, profiles perpetrators and heroes, and explains international laws and law proceedings aimed at ending genocide and crimes against humanity at specific groups or at least punishing those who have committed such crimes. It also delves into depictions and manifestations of the phenomenon, such as propaganda, sociological and philosophical explanations, literature, and film.\nThis is the first comprehensive reference work to cover the international history of genocide and crimes against humanity (not only genocide or the Holocaust). Articles span the fields of history, film/drama, literature, law, psychology, sociology, and political science.\n\n           \n\n...............................................................................\n\n\nAmazon links and more NFO on the forum here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=31015&amp;pid=132133#pid132133&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=31015&amp;pid=132133#pid132133&lt;/a&gt;\n\n(Scroll down a bit)\n\n==========================================================================\n\n\nReport bad torrents here: &lt;a href=&quot; http://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&lt;/a&gt;\n\nMy uploads: &lt;a href=&quot; http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=31015&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=31015&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n==========================================================================\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:39cf10b31cb60c500e859b248f12118f8f780882","amp;dn":"Gale.Encyclopedia+of+Genocide+and+Crimes+Against+Humanity+%5B101%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"39cf10b31cb60c500e859b248f12118f8f780882","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,207,16,179,28,182,12,80,14,133,155,36,143,18,17,143,143,120,8,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
