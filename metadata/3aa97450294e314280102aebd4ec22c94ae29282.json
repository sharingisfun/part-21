With her single mother's increasing pregnancy and refusal to work, Sadie has to take over her mother's job as a domestic servant for one of the wealthy summer families on a nearby island.\n\nWhen the family arrives at their summer getaway, Sadie is surprised to learn that the owner of the house is Jax Stone, one of the hottest teen rockers in the world. If Sadie hadn't spent her life raising her mother and taking care of the house she might have been normal enough to be excited about working for a rock star.\n\nEven though Sadie isn't impressed by Jax's fame, he is drawn to her. Everything about Sadie fascinates Jax but he fights his attraction. Relationships never work in his world and as badly as he wants Sadie, he believes she deserves more. By the end of the summer, Jax discovers he can't breathe without Sadie.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3aa97450294e314280102aebd4ec22c94ae29282","amp;dn":"Abbi+Glines+-+Breathe+%28Sea+Breeze+%231%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3aa97450294e314280102aebd4ec22c94ae29282","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,169,116,80,41,78,49,66,128,16,42,235,212,236,34,201,74,226,146,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
