A former merchant marine and psychiatric attendant, he lived among the down-and-out on New York's Lower East Side. In the story &quot;Keep 'em Flying,&quot; Deitch portrays himself as a hypnotized figure who ends up on another planet with one of his own characters, the cigar-smoking Waldo the cat. The goofily interesting Famous Frauds series relates the history of a supposedly mechanical chess player and the hard lives of those who actually sweated inside the huge contraption, preying on an unsuspecting chess-playing public. The best story, &quot;Two Jews from Yonkers,&quot; is an autobiographical, squalid tale about cartooning, drugs and the Pope. The drawing style here has Sunday-morning-funnies charm as interpreted by a hippie/Bowery bum.\n\n\nBrings together 23 short stories of varying lengths. \n\nAlso by Kim Deitch\n\nThe Boulevard of Broken Dreams &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8517375/Kim_Deitch_-_The_Boulevard_of_Broken_Dreams&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8517375/Kim_Deitch_-_The_Boulevard_of_Broken_Dreams&lt;/a&gt;\n\nA Shroud For Waldo &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8584931/A_Shroud_For_Waldo&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8584931/A_Shroud_For_Waldo&lt;/a&gt;\n\nOr just click on his name in the Tags up above.
