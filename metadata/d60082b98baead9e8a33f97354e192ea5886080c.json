An Applied Approach Through Examples\n      ================================================================\n\n\n\n\nR, an Open Source software, has become the de facto statistical computing environment. It has an excellent collection of data manipulation and graphics capabilities. It is extensible and comes with a large number of packages that allow statistical analysis at all levels - from simple to advanced - and in numerous fields including Medicine, Genetics, Biology, Environmental Sciences, Geology, Social Sciences and much more. The software is maintained and developed by academicians and professionals and as such, is continuously evolving and up to date. Statistics and Data with R presents an accessible guide to data manipulations, statistical analysis and graphics using R.\nAssuming no previous knowledge of statistics or R, the book includes:\nA comprehensive introduction to the R language.\n\nAuthor: Cohen J.Y., Cohen Y.\nTitle: Statistics and Data with R. An Applied Approach Through Examples\nPublisher: Wiley\nYear: 2008\nFormat: PDF\n\n\n================================================================================\n\n\n\n                    Mathematical Statistics with Resampling and R\n                    =============================================\n\n\nResampling helps students understand the meaning of sampling distributions, sampling variability, P-values, hypothesis tests, and confidence intervals. This groundbreaking book shows how to apply modern resampling techniques to mathematical statistics. Extensively class-tested to ensure an accessible presentation, Mathematical Statistics with Resampling and R utilizes the powerful and flexible computer language R to underscore the significance and benefits of modern resampling techniques.\nThe book begins by introducing permutation tests and bootstrap methods, motivating classical inference methods.\nStriking a balance between theory, computing, and applications, the authors explore additional topics such as:\nExploratory data analysis\nCalculation of sampling distributions\nThe Central Limit Theorem\nMonte Carlo sampling\nMaximum likelihood estimation and properties of estimators\nConfidence intervals and hypothesis tests\nRegression\nBayesian methods\nThroughout the book, case studies on diverse subjects such as flight delays, birth weights of babies, and telephone company repair times illustrate the relevance of the real-world applications of the discussed material. Key definitions and theorems of important probability distributions are collected at the end of the book, and a related website is also available, featuring additional material including data sets, R scripts, and helpful teaching hints.\nMathematical Statistics with Resampling and R is an excellent book for courses on mathematical statistics at the upper-undergraduate and graduate levels. It also serves as a valuable reference for applied statisticians working in the areas of business, economics, biostatistics, and public health who utilize resampling methods in their everyday work.\n\nAuthor: Chihara L.M., Hesterberg T.C.\nTitle: Mathematical Statistics with Resampling and R\nPublisher: Wiley\nYear: 2011\nFormat: PDF\n\n\n2010kaiser home page at The Pirate Bay link below:\n\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2010kaiser/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2010kaiser/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nCheck out the new PirateWiki!
