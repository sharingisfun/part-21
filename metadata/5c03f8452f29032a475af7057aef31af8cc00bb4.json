In this vital new book, the term bioclimatic, relating to the dynamic between climate and living organisms, is applied by the authors in focusing on countries where housing requires cooling for a significant part of the year. In this context, Bioclimatic Housing covers creative, vernacular architecture to present both the theory and practice of innovative, low-energy architecture. The book interweaves the themes of social progress, technological fixes and industry transformation within a discussion of global and country trends, climate types, solutions and technologies. Prepared under the auspices of a 5-year International Energy Agency (IEA) project, and with case studies from Iran, Malaysia, Australia, Japan, Sri Lanka and Italy, this is a truly international and authoritative work, providing an essential primer for building designers, builders, developers and advanced students in architecture and engineering.\n\n\n# Paperback: 400 pages\n# Publisher: Routledge (December 11, 2007)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 1844072843\n# ISBN-13: 978-1844072842","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c03f8452f29032a475af7057aef31af8cc00bb4","amp;dn":"Bioclimatic+Housing%3AInnovative+Designs+for+Warm+Climates%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c03f8452f29032a475af7057aef31af8cc00bb4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,3,248,69,47,41,3,42,71,90,247,5,122,239,49,175,140,192,11,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
