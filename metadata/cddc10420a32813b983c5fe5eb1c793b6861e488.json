It provides an overview of the evolution of housing development, and includes present day schemes and estate regeneration as well as special sections on housing in Scotland and Northern Ireland. The photographs and plans of historic and contemporary projects can be used to show design approaches to clients, committees and, in the case of regeneration, with local communities. Looking back into history will indicate which design approaches have been successful.\n\nThis fully updated 2nd edition includes a new chapter on the development of design concepts and projects built since 1999. It illustrates current trends that have been developing since the turn of the new century, and emphasises the concept of creating sustainable communities. The use of colour photographs adds a new dimension to the first edition in making it possible to appreciate more readily the materials used in the design of the housing and its environment.\n\n* A valuable sourcebook for this booming industry\n* A comprehensive history of housing from 1900 to the present day\n* A unique, reference, presented in full colour ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cddc10420a32813b983c5fe5eb1c793b6861e488","amp;dn":"RIBA+Book+of+British+Housing%2C+2nd+Edition+-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cddc10420a32813b983c5fe5eb1c793b6861e488","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,220,16,66,10,50,129,59,152,60,95,229,235,28,121,59,104,97,228,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
