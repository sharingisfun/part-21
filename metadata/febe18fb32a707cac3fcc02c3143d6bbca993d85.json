Fueled by all genres of music, mad amounts of booze and herbs, and plate after plate of hometown BBQ, they are set to take the world by storm with their new full-length release titled &quot;thunderalbum9million&quot;. The band's MC's, CooLaid and KB, are perfectly matched with the musical backing of Nick Dubb on Bass, Matt X on drums, and DJ Dulo on the scratches to create a new and raw form of music unlike anything known to mankind. Ears will melt, ipods will explode, you're slice of leftover pie in the fridge will be gone. BluntRap is about to dominate.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:febe18fb32a707cac3fcc02c3143d6bbca993d85","amp;dn":"BluntRap+%28Kottonmouth+Kings%2C+Rage+Against+the+Machine%2C+Shuvel%2C+%28","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"febe18fb32a707cac3fcc02c3143d6bbca993d85","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,190,24,251,50,167,7,202,195,252,192,44,49,67,214,187,202,153,61,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
