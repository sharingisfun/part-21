The impossibly winsome girl with the tortoise-shell specs who staged a bloodless coup on MTV thanks to a strategically-placed cut on the REALITY BITES soundtrack? The one who shamelessly pledged allegiance to Olivia Newton John and endeared herself to every teenage girl with a diary full of subversive secrets? She's back for a second round of radio-friendly alterna-pop on FIRECRACKER. Loeb earned a Grammy nomination for her last effort, and a legion of fans who will find this album full of the same sparkly pop-rock confections they gobbled up so avidly on the gold-certified TAILS.\n\nRecorded at 52nd St. Digital, Clinton Recording Studios, Avatar Studios and Juan's Apartment, New York, New York; Dreamland, Woodstock, New York; Groovemasters Studio, Santa Monica, California.\n\nPersonnel: Lisa Loeb (vocals, acoustic guitar, electric guitar); Mark Spencer, Tony Berg (electric guitar); Tom Chiu, Ann Kim, Helen Kim, Anne Chalez, Janet Sung, Joseph Lin, Sang-Mi Lee, Naomi Katz, Nurit Bar-Josef, Jennifer Frautschi, Yosuke Kawaski, Colin Jacobsen, Pauline Kim (violin); Leo Suzuki, Martin Sher, Conway Kuo (viola); Eric Gaenslen, Pitnarry Shin, Matthew Herren, Nina Lee (cello); David Gresham (clarinet); Juan Patino (piano, vibraphone, drums, bongos, shaker, tambourine, triangle, loops); John &quot;J.
