Jason Hawes and Grant Wilson are two plumbers working for Roto-Rooter in New England. They are also the co-founders of TAPS - The Atlantic Paranormal Society - a paranormal research team which investigates hauntings and other strange occurrences. This one-hour weekly show (dubbed a &quot;docu-soap&quot; by the Sci-Fi Channel) follows their investigations from first contact through the gathering of evidence, and to the reveal of that evidence to the client. Every week Jason, Grant, and their team investigate a new case, from poltergeists who throw a child's toys around an attic to a lighthouse whose late keeper still welcomes visitors. This team of moonlighting ghost hunters are our first and last defense against uninvited paranormal visitations.\nNetwork: SciFi","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5e3b5aa87d30019624fe5e544bc6e0827ae7f0c","amp;dn":"Ghost+Hunters+S08E04+HDTV+XVID-BAJSKORV%5Bettv%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5e3b5aa87d30019624fe5e544bc6e0827ae7f0c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,227,181,170,135,211,0,25,98,79,229,229,68,188,110,8,39,174,127,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
