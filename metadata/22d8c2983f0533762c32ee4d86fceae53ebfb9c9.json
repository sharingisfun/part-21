Considering she is a vampire, and has been for over two hundred years, she feels right at home. Her sanctuary proves fleeting however when she finds the new assistant curator breaking into an exhibit. Instead of acting surprised, Nathan confronts her with a strange proposition - help him find the legendary Shroud of Lazarus, a relic said to cure any ill, including her vampirism. Agreeing, they set off but soon realize that it is a dangerous \nquest leading them to resolve a deadly past and confront an impending evil.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22d8c2983f0533762c32ee4d86fceae53ebfb9c9","amp;dn":"Born+Into+Darkness+-+New+HOG+Adventure+-+Wendy99","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22d8c2983f0533762c32ee4d86fceae53ebfb9c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,216,194,152,63,5,51,118,44,50,238,77,134,252,234,229,62,191,185,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
