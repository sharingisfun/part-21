Each piece is composed of a certain number of pre-colombian styled stone heads of a certain color. You can rotate the pieces and change their color arrangement too. Then you have it fall down where you want to make a match.\n\nThere are two play modes: Adventure or Arcade. I seem to remember that in Adventure mode you have a fixed time limit and a number of stones to break (by matching them), while in Arcade you have one challenge per level. For example, you must reach a certain amount of combinations (sometimes specific combos) to get to the next level.\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\nOS: Windows XP/Vista/Win7\nCPU: 1.2 GHz\nRAM: 512 MB\nDirectX: 9.0\nHard Drive: 10 MB\n\n\n[img]http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6061/6025034526_3e50cf5dde.jpg[/img]\n\nWork like you don't need money, love like you've never been hurt, and dance like no one's watching\n- Unknown Author -\n\nAnd Seed like there is no bandwith limit :)\n\nSupport Us\nYour &quot;Thank You&quot; means a lot\n\n[img]http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5029/5841348205_e896fe6f30.jpg[/img]\n\n\nThanks to Wendy\n\nAnd Let's never forget the work of Flight of the Conchords","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6289d4eb114fd89062db3a1fc0269fcf90b90f77","amp;dn":"Incadia+-+NEW+Puzzle%2C++Match+3+Game+%5BAllSmartGames%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6289d4eb114fd89062db3a1fc0269fcf90b90f77","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,137,212,235,17,79,216,144,98,219,58,31,192,38,159,207,144,185,15,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
