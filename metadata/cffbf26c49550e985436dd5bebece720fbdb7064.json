The Appalachian flavor is, if anything, a little more pronounced than usual, but the songwriting is utterly contemporary, and the Irwin-Bean harmonies among their best. &quot;Binding Twine,&quot; with its delectably sad melody and vocals, has the makings of a modern classic; &quot;Jesus Year&quot; has some great trembling harmonies; and &quot;Slowride,&quot; more unexpectedly, has the country-rock punch of the late-'60s Byrds in that group's better moments. Most unusual lyrical twist: &quot;Louisville Lip,&quot; inspired by Muhammad Ali's toss of his gold medal into the Ohio River after getting denied service at a restaurant. Max Konrad Johnston, formerly of Wilco, helps out on guitar, fiddle, banjo, Dobro, mandolin, and vocals, helping devise a sound that is both spare and textured.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cffbf26c49550e985436dd5bebece720fbdb7064","amp;dn":"Freakwater+-+Springtime+%5B1998%5D%5BEAC%2FFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cffbf26c49550e985436dd5bebece720fbdb7064","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,251,242,108,73,85,14,152,84,54,221,91,235,236,231,32,251,219,112,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
