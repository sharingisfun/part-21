Jakubisko: &quot;The music is second only to the image as the most important part of film for me. The reason why I picked this topic was just a question of natural development. Magical realism is combined with the real world of the fairytale fiction. I made my mind up, wrote it and directed the story that makes this principle alive. With this musical fairytale I tried to touch the teenage generation - the age in which magical realism is part of life.&quot; \nÃ£â‚¬â‚¬Ã£â‚¬â‚¬1 hour 33 min / color \nÃ£â‚¬â‚¬Ã£â‚¬â‚¬Premiere screening: 1990 \nÃ£â‚¬â‚¬Ã£â‚¬â‚¬Produced by: Czechoslovak TV, Czechoslovakia / TV 2000 Wiesbaden, West Germany \nÃ£â‚¬â‚¬Ã£â‚¬â‚¬Written, Screenplay and Directed by: Juraj Jakubisko \nÃ£â‚¬â‚¬Ã£â‚¬â‚¬Director of Photography: Jan Ã„Å½uriÃ…Â¡ \nÃ£â‚¬â‚¬Ã£â‚¬â‚¬Music by: Ladislav Ã…Â taidl\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:735670b1d02d11ee0e479949fe11db04193f35dd","amp;dn":"Takmer+ruzovy+pr%26iacute%3Bbeh+A+rosy+story%281990%29voice%3ARus+OR+Cez+J","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"735670b1d02d11ee0e479949fe11db04193f35dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,86,112,177,208,45,17,238,14,71,153,73,254,17,219,4,25,63,53,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
