We do provide in the appendix a fairly extensive discussion \nand summary of the general techniques needed in the text, with hopes that \nit may lead the reader to a fuller appreciation of the Dellacherie-Meyer \nvolumes...\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:586db02420ab8776e9f93f06c0b04d643f277534","amp;dn":"General+Theory+of+Markov+Processes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"586db02420ab8776e9f93f06c0b04d643f277534","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,109,176,36,32,171,135,118,233,249,63,6,192,176,77,100,63,39,117,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
