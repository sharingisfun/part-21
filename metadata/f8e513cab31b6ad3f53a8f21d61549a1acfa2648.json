After ruining a day's shooting as an extra on a film, he finds himself unintentionally invited to a big Hollywood party. He's a walking disaster area and the slapstick humor (not easy to keep funny over time) is hilarious.\n\n  Starring: Peter Sellers, Claudine Longet, Natalia Borisova, Jean Carson, Marge Champion.\n\n  Directed by: Blake Edwards.\n\n  Quality: Very Good Xvid from DVD.\n\n  Length: 1hr. 35min.\n\n  Language: English.\n\n  Size: 720 x 336","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8e513cab31b6ad3f53a8f21d61549a1acfa2648","amp;dn":"The+Party+%281968%29+%28Peter+Sellers%2C+Claudine+Longet%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f8e513cab31b6ad3f53a8f21d61549a1acfa2648","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,229,19,202,179,27,106,211,245,58,143,33,214,21,73,161,172,250,38,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
