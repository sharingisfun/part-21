Some of the band's albums are heavily folk influenced, while others have a more traditional black metal sound. Their lyrics retell Norse legends, and each of their albums has its own theme. The band split up in early 2004 after releasing the album Blot in December 2003, but later reformed .\n\nIn December 2004, all members of Einherjer's last lineup, including the band's founders Frode Glesnes and Gerhard Storesund, founded the thrash metal band Battered together with bass guitarist Ole MoldesÃƒÂ¦ther.\n\nIn September 2008, Einherjer announced that they would reunite to do some selected shows across Europe in 2009, including the RagnarÃƒÂ¶k, Kaltenbach and Wacken festivals. The band signed with Indie Recordings in December 2010; a new album was released in September 2011.\n\nThe band's name is taken from Norse mythology, where the term Einherjar describes the slain warriors who have gone to Valhalla and joined Odin's table.\n\nYear: 2014\nCountry: Norway, Haugesund\nGenre: Viking Metal\nCodec: Mp3\nBitrate: 2560Kbps\n\nTRACKLIST:\n01.
