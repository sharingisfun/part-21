The fogbound sets are deliciously creepy, the graveyard &amp; crypt sets nothing short of fabulous! The spooky music adds a lot as well. Bela Lugosi, about 60 here and well into the undeserved waning days of his career, is damn good. Tall, imposing, and as strong a screen prescence as ever, he raises questions as to why the often heartless and stupid film industry did not make better use of his talents. He shows here that he could certainly still carry a film and command the screen. But the script needed work. Matt Willis as the talking werewolf is laughable. When he's seen entering the graveyard carrying what looks like a package of Chinese laundry, I howled! I just couldn't see him running shopping errands in his werewolf garb! And no explanation is offered as to why the vampire's slave turns into a werewolf, a state he retains regardless of whether or not the moon is full. He's a wolf even in broad daylight. Still, this is a fun, somewhat creepy film, and Lugosi is always worthy of your time.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82ba8e8ead19337dc32c045c07c91e93e1470954","amp;dn":"Return+of+the+Vampire+The+%28Bela+Lugosi%29+%5B1944%5D+%40%21+.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82ba8e8ead19337dc32c045c07c91e93e1470954","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,186,142,142,173,25,51,125,195,44,4,92,7,201,30,147,225,71,9,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
