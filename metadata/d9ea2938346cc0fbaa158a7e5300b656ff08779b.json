That's certainly the case on 1971's Tupelo Honey, one of the finest albums of Morrison's long career. Kicking off with the classic &quot;Wild Night,&quot; Tupelo Honey is as completely joyous as the normally bitter Van gets, particularly on the title track and the unabashedly grateful,\nslow-building &quot;You're My Woman,&quot; both among the most moving love songs he's recorded. --David Cantwell\n\nAlbum opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic,\nHHI does not express an opinion either way with regard to the quality\nof the band etc. We hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!\n\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.Wild night                                           [03:35]\n02.(straight to your heart) like A cannonball           [03:42]\n03.Old old woodstock                                    [04:17]\n04.Starting A new life                                  [02:10]\n05.You're my woman                                      [06:43]\n06.Tupelo honey                                         [06:54]\n07.I want to roo you (scottish derivative)              [03:27]\n08.When that evening sun goes down                      [03:06]\n09.Moonshine whiskey                                    [06:49]\n____\n\n40:43 min\n 62,4 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9ea2938346cc0fbaa158a7e5300b656ff08779b","amp;dn":"Van_Morrison-Tupelo_Honey-%28Retail%29-1971-HHI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9ea2938346cc0fbaa158a7e5300b656ff08779b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,234,41,56,52,108,192,251,170,21,138,126,83,0,182,86,255,8,119,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
