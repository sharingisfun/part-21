That means that he'll have to find period doors for the entrances, get up the clapboard, and find a mason to build the fireboxes and chimney.

It's a lot to balance, especially when Daryl has to go out on tour","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c36ddb986366af5d3dda700f3b1893435d754e49","amp;dn":"Daryl.Hall.Daryl%27s.Restoration.Over-Hall.S01E05.720p.X264.SCREEN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c36ddb986366af5d3dda700f3b1893435d754e49","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,109,219,152,99,102,175,93,61,218,112,15,59,24,147,67,93,117,78,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
