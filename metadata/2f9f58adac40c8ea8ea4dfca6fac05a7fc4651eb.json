His philosophy has touched the lives of some of the most powerful individuals in the country, from Wall Street leaders to such sports luminaries as Terry Bradshaw. Flippen&quot;s approach is simple. When we learn how to identify our &quot;personal constraints&quot; and take the steps to correct self-limiting behaviors, we will experience a surge in productivity, achieve things we have only dreamed of, and find greater happiness. Flippen has created a simple process to help listeners find their greatest limitation and then to &quot;flip&quot; that weakness into a newfound strength.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f9f58adac40c8ea8ea4dfca6fac05a7fc4651eb","amp;dn":"The+Flip+Side+-+Break+Free+of+the+Behaviors+That+Hold+You+Back+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f9f58adac40c8ea8ea4dfca6fac05a7fc4651eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,159,88,173,172,64,200,234,142,164,223,202,111,172,5,167,252,70,81,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
