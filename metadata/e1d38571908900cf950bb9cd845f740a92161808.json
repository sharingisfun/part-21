Oda drew Romance Dawn as two separate pirate stories that ran in Weekly Shonen Jump&amp;#039;s Summer Special issue and 41st issue of 1996. Both stories featured a young pirate named Monkey D. Luffy as the main character, but were otherwise much different from each other and the actual One Piece manga that launched in 1997. Oda named One Piece&amp;#039;s first installment &quot;Romance Dawn&quot; after these earlier manga stories. The two Romance Dawn one-shot manga stories have been republished in the One Piece Red and Wanted books.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1d38571908900cf950bb9cd845f740a92161808","amp;dn":"%5BFLV+-+JAP+MP3+-+SUB+ENG%5DOne+Piece%3A+Romance+Dawn+Story%5Btntvillag","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e1d38571908900cf950bb9cd845f740a92161808","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,211,133,113,144,137,0,207,149,11,185,205,132,95,116,10,146,22,24,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
