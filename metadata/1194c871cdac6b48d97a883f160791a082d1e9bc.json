Blest roams the \nNew York streets, spraying graffiti wherever he can and dodging angry shop \nowners as he steals spray paint from hardware stores. The art world tugs at \nBlest's sleeve as he slowly makes a name for himself, with several galleries \ninterested in displaying his work, but he has more pressing concerns as one \nof his gang, Lune (Jade Yorker), winds up in jail. Discovering Lune has been \nbadly beaten by the cops, Blest instructs his gang to cover the city with \ngraffiti, starting a deadly running battle with the cops. A movie that \nhighlights how difficult it is for many youngsters to escape the impoverished \nbackgrounds they grew up in, Lough's film is also an interesting look at graffiti \nculture and the talented characters who love to decorate New York with their work.\n\n\n\t\t\n\n- File Size: 825.6 MB\n- Duration: 1:31:12\n- Bitrate: 1265 Kbps\n\n*** Video Track Parameters ***\n- Video track format: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC\n- Video stream size: 718 MB (87%)\n- FourCC: avc1\n- Frame rate (fps): \nMax.: 29.981\nAverage: 29.970\nMin.: 29.944\n- Bitrate mode: Variable\n- Encoding profile: &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;b0fdd1d9def0fc829e81&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n- Resolution: 24 bits\n- Video width (Pixel number): 512\n- Video height (Pixel number): 272\n- Pixel Aspect Ratio: Undefined\n- Display aspect ratio: 1.882\n- Chroma subsampling format: YUV420p\n- Video encoding library: x264 core 65\n\n*** Audio Track Parameters ***\n- Audio track format: AAC - MPEG-4 audio\n- Audio stream size: 104 MB (13%)\n- Audio FourCC: 0xFF\n- Language(s): \n1: Undefined\n- Audio details: -\n- Audio Profile: Low Complexity\n- Audio bitrate: 160 Kbps\n- Audio bitrate mode: Variable\n- Audio resolution: 16 bits\n- Audio rate: 48.0 KHz\n- Position: Left Right\n\nNotes: If you like these kind of DvDs search SCUM and youll find more1!!!\nIF you think you could help in anyway or just want to drop in and say thanks, find us in IRC!!!  \nirc.p2p-networks.net\n#SCUM","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1194c871cdac6b48d97a883f160791a082d1e9bc","amp;dn":"%5BGraffiti%5D+Bomb.The.System.2002.DvDRiP.h.264.AAC-SCUM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1194c871cdac6b48d97a883f160791a082d1e9bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,148,200,113,205,172,107,72,217,122,136,63,22,7,145,160,130,209,233,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
