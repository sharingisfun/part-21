That\\'s OK - I also included DMG and ISO masters of the DVD itself so you can do as you will with it. \n\nPlease download and share. Upload the torrent to other trackers. Make it available. \n\nAnd if you feel so inclined, show some love to Beirut and BaDaBing. It\\\\\\'s pretty cool that they were so excited about doing this. \t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:70f1a0c04b9c65125a7724f771a3334f7e6d5301","amp;dn":"Beirut+%26+La+Blogotheque+Present+%5C%27Cheap+Magic+Inside%5C%27+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"70f1a0c04b9c65125a7724f771a3334f7e6d5301","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,241,160,192,75,156,101,18,90,119,36,247,113,163,51,79,126,109,83,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
