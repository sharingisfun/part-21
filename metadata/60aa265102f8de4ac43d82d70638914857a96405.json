CÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©cile falls in love with the Chevalier Danceny (her music tutor) and Merteuil and Valmont pretend to want to help the secret lovers in order to gain their trust, so that they can use them later in their own schemes......................\n\n\n\n\nThe Cast:\n\nMarquise de Merteuil...........Diana Rigg\nVicomte de Valmont.............Roger Allam\nMadame de Tourvel..............Juliet Stevenson\nMadame de Rosemonde............Gudrun Ure\nCÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©cile de Volanges.............Alison Reid\nMadame Volanges................Melinda Walker\nRaphael Danceny................Samuel West\n\nDirected by Clive Brill\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: tape recording of broadcast material\n\n\nType                : mpeg 1 layer III\nBitrate             : 128\nMode                : stereo\nFrequency           : 44100 Hz\nFrames              : 65126\nLength              : 00:28:21\nEncoder             : Gogo (before 3.0)\nEncoded By          : auntadadoom\n\n\nRipped from the audio torrent site radioarchive.cc\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:60aa265102f8de4ac43d82d70638914857a96405","amp;dn":"Les+Liasons+Dangereuses++-++Choderlos+de+Laclos++%28BBC+1992%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"60aa265102f8de4ac43d82d70638914857a96405","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,170,38,81,2,248,222,74,196,61,130,215,6,56,145,72,87,169,100,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
