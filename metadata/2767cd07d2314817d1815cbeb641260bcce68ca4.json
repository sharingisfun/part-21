Skagra, an up-and-coming would-be conqueror of the universe, needs the assistance of one of the prison&amp;#039;s inmates, but finds that nobody knows where Shada is anymore except one aged Time Lord who has retired to Earth, where he is masquerading as a professor at St. Cedd&amp;#039;s College, Cambridge (the story features some on-location filming in Cambridge, all of which was completed before the strike). Luckily for the fate of the universe, Skagra&amp;#039;s attempt to force the information out of Professor Chronotis coincides with a visit by the professor&amp;#039;s old friend the Doctor (and this is where the story really begins).\n\n\nNote:\nThis is the webcast version capped from the HQ broadband version\n\n\nStarring\n\nThe Doctor ÃƒÂ¢??
