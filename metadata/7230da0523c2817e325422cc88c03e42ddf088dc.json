Well-known songs by the band include &quot;Michael (Jump In)&quot;, &quot;Sweep The Leg&quot;, and &quot;Zombie Me&quot;.\n\nThe name &quot;No More Kings&quot; comes from an episode of School House Rock, one of many of No More Kings' inspirations. The particular episode dealt with the Pilgrims leaving England, seeking freedom and independence.\n\nNo More Kings are led by front man Pete Mitchell (born September 7th, 1973 in Providence, Rhode Island), who is responsible for writing the songs on the album along with longtime friend Neil Robins of the Louisville-based band Dirt Poor Robins. Pete studied fine art in college and has worked for Disney and the Jim Henson Company; he is an accomplished animator and also speaks Japanese. Pete claims his main sources of musical inspiration are the Beatles, Michael Jackson, Radiohead, Billy Joel, Beck, and Genesis.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7230da0523c2817e325422cc88c03e42ddf088dc","amp;dn":"No+More+Kings+-+No+More+Kings+%5B2007%5D+-+192kbps+-+KnuxAran","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7230da0523c2817e325422cc88c03e42ddf088dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,48,218,5,35,194,129,126,50,84,34,204,136,192,62,66,221,240,136,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
