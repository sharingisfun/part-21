The first three songs, which were acoustic mood music, were recorded between October and December 1996. At that time the band had three members: Tuomas, Tarja and Emppu. Originally, Tarja Turunen wasn&amp;#039;t into metal at all (nor did she even know what it was). She was approached by the first two members at her school at the time and asked to join because they knew she was one of the best singers in the school.\n\nTrivia: Tuomas Holopainen is a huge fanatic of Disney animation and he loves Disneyworld in Florida, USA. Nightwish has played some shows there at the Blues Club, and at that time, the Disney film &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; was in theaters, leading to the misconception that the song &amp;#039;Nemo&amp;#039; has something to do with movie. The truth is Nemo is Latin for &amp;#039;nobody&amp;#039; and the name is a coincidence. At Nightwish live shows, it&amp;#039;s been known for people to throw the Nemo fish character plush doll on stage to the band.\n\nFormer lead singer Tarja Turunen was fired with an &amp;#039;open letter&amp;#039; by the 4 other band members on Oct. 22, 2005. It took until May 2007 for her replacement, Anette Olzon (of the AOR band Alyson Avenue) to be announced.\n\nThe band did 3 surprise gigs in Autumn 2007, pretending to be various Nightwish cover bands: Sep 22nd in Tallinn, Estonia as Nachtwasser, &quot;the German cover band&quot;; Sep 26th in Helsinki, Finland as Natuvissyset, &quot;the Estonian cover band&quot; and Sep 28th in Hamburg, Germany as Sushi Patrol, &quot;the Japanese cover band&quot;.&quot;\n\nBirth dates:\nAnette Olzon Blyckert (21st June 1971, Katrineholm, Sweden)\nTarja Soile Susanna Turunen Cabuli (17th August 1977, Kitee, Finland)\nTuomas Lauri Johannes Holopainen (25th December 1976, Kitee, Finland)\nErno Matti Juhani Vuorinen (24th June 1978, Kitee, Finland)\nMarko Tapani Hietala (born January 14, 1966, Tervo, Finland)\nJukka Antero Nevalainen (21st April 1978, Finland)\nSami VÃƒï¿½Ã‚Â´nskÃƒï¿½Ã‚Â´ (26th September 1976, Finland)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14b70d574b34a5557b46c90134952281dd6ca16e","amp;dn":"Nightwish","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14b70d574b34a5557b46c90134952281dd6ca16e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,183,13,87,75,52,165,85,123,70,201,1,52,149,34,129,221,108,161,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
