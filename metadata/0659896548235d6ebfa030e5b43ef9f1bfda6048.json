As soon as his new family members show signs of being human and not robots who will march unquestioningly to his tune, his dreams of domestic bliss begins to crumble, and he kills them. Then he alters his appearance, assumes an new identity, and skips to another town to begin the deadly ritual all over again. He marries Susan Maine, who sees him as the ideal surrogate father for her teenage daughter Stephanie, and is soon up to his old tricks when she proves too much of a troublesome teen to handle.\n\nMedia: 512 x 368\nSubtitles: YES, swedish\nVideo: XVID 512x368 25.00fps 1006Kbps [Video 0]\nAudio: MPEG Audio Layer 3 48000Hz stereo 128Kbps [Audio 1]\nRipped by: Uzm","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0659896548235d6ebfa030e5b43ef9f1bfda6048","amp;dn":"The.Stepfather.1987.SWESUB.DVDRip.XviD-Uzm","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0659896548235d6ebfa030e5b43ef9f1bfda6048","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,89,137,101,72,35,93,110,191,160,48,229,180,62,249,241,191,218,96,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
