The book is written primarily as a basic learning tool for the undergraduate student in civil and mechanical engineering whose main interest is in stress analysis and heat transfer. The text is geared toward those who want to apply the finite element method as a tool to solve practical physical problems. \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:587331c74191d4a9c8684e17af0f37aa998d1b80","amp;dn":"A+First+Course+in+the+Finite+Element+Method","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"587331c74191d4a9c8684e17af0f37aa998d1b80","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,115,49,199,65,145,212,169,200,104,78,23,175,15,55,170,153,141,27,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
