Frankl is among the most influential \nworks of psychiatric literature since Freud.\n\nThe book begins with a lengthy, austere, and deeply moving personal essay about Frankl's imprisonment in Auschwitz and other concentration camps for five years, and his struggle during this time to find reasons to live. \n\nThe second part of the book, called &quot;Logotherapy in a Nutshell,&quot; describes the psychotherapeutic method that Frankl pioneered as a result of his experiences in the concentration camps. Freud believed that sexual instincts and urges were the driving force of humanity's life; Frankl, by contrast, believes that man's deepest \ndesire is to search for meaning and purpose. Frankl's logotherapy, therefore, \nis much more compatible with Western religions than Freudian psychotherapy.\n \nThis is a fascinating, sophisticated, and very human book. At times, \nFrankl's personal and professional discourses merge into a style of \ntremendous power. &quot;Our generation is realistic, for we have come to \nknow man as he really is,&quot; Frankl writes. &quot;After all, man is that being \nwho invented the gas chambers of Auschwitz; however, he is also that \nbeing who entered those gas chambers upright, with the Lord's Prayer \nor the Shema Yisrael on his lips.&quot;\n\n(Note: This book was recommended to me by my therapist )\n\n\n***** Sharing is caring, please SEED! *****\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4bf8e275127db98e119c764fd2c826f2971ae40","amp;dn":"Viktor+Frankl+-+Man%5C%27s+Search+for+Meaning.zip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4bf8e275127db98e119c764fd2c826f2971ae40","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,191,142,39,81,39,219,152,225,25,199,100,253,44,130,111,41,113,174,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
