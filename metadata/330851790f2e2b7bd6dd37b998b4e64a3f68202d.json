A significant portion is devoted to groundbreaking methods for the production of plants that are able to degrade, take up, or tolerate the effects of pollutants. The book adopts a multidisciplinary approach to the examination of principles and practices of phytoremediation","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:330851790f2e2b7bd6dd37b998b4e64a3f68202d","amp;dn":"Methods+in+Biotechnology+23+-+Phytoremediation","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"330851790f2e2b7bd6dd37b998b4e64a3f68202d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,8,81,121,15,46,43,123,214,221,55,185,152,180,230,74,63,104,32,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
