Let me say that this movie is unbelievably stupid, has TONS of fights, and is one of my favorite fu-flicks, ever!\r\n\r\nWe start with Bruce Li, Lo Meng, and their mutual romantic interest (lovely woman, never seen her before or since) coming to Hong Kong on a small boat, just about to give up hope when they see land. Once there, the boys have no problem getting work, but get into trouble when they defend a young black man (Scott) being bullied by the rich, white employees.\r\n They kick the crap out of everyone and all 3 lose their jobs. Word of this fight gets around the city quickly as all future attempts at employment are met with obstacles from either the dudes they beat up or acquaintances of the dudes they beat up, particularly the city's big boss man, played with typical awesomeness by Ku Feng (&quot;Avenging Eagle&quot;).\r\n\r\nThough this release is listed as &quot;uncut&quot;, it is exactly the same as my old VHS copy, complete with the alternate ending, which is not a special feature, but plays after the film's ending. As the back cover lists the things that were edited from other versions and I noticed nothing new, I'll have to assume that this is NOT uncut.\r\n This copy is the only one I know of available in the U.S. on DVD and is a bootleg from Bonzai Media, making the price as silly as the film. If you love cheesy 70s kung fu I would recommend this but not when it's this expensive. English dubbed only, and poorly, which suits me just fine.\r\n\r\nSCREENSHOTS:\r\n  \nhttp://someimage.com/5CobH7G\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThis is personally brought to you by the Carjackers, from The Chop Shop.\r\nLeave your thoughts/opinions and ratings on the A/V of this film for others to see.
