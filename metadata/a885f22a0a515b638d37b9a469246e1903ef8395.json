Each Sister has been trained in the art of battle since childhood. The series focuses on the life of BoronwÃƒÂ«, a young woman coming of age in a world where survival rests on the edge of a blade.\n\nThey were first published as an eight-issue limited series by Epic Comics, a division of Marvel Comics that specialized in creator-owned books for an adult audience. Mike Vosburg did the artwork.\n\nMarx and Epic were in negotiations to continue with a series of graphic novels, until this was derailed in a disagreement over content restrictions on the books.\n\nSubsequently, Marx took the series to Eclipse Comics, which in partnership with Moonfire Productions (Marx's self-publishing imprint), published the graphic novel, BoronwÃƒÂ«: Daughter of Death, in both paperback and hardcover. Peter Ledger illustrated it.\n\nThis torrent is for the eight issues from epic. I do not have the Eclipse graphic novel. If anyone does, please upload!\n\nGet it, pay it forward. Kudos to the creative team and the scanners.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a885f22a0a515b638d37b9a469246e1903ef8395","amp;dn":"Sisterhood+of+Steel+%28epic+Comics%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a885f22a0a515b638d37b9a469246e1903ef8395","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,133,242,42,10,81,91,99,141,55,185,164,105,36,110,25,3,239,131,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
