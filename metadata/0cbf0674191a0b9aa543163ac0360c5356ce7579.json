Integrated nutrient management, efficient water management, and forecasting models for pests diseases outbreaks and integrated pest and pest management have also added new dimensions in breeding for sustainable production. With the rise in demand, the scientific community has responded positively by directing a greater amount of research towards sustainable production both for edible and industrial uses.\r\n\r\nCovering the latest information on various major world oil crops including rapeseed mustard, sunflower, groundnut, sesame, oilpalm, cotton, linseed/flax, castor and olive, this book brings the latest advances together in a single volume for researchers and advanced level students.\r\n\r\n\r\nDescribes various methods and systems to achieve sustainable production in all major oilseed crops\r\nAddresses breeding, biology and utilization aspects simultaneously including those species whose information is not available elsewhere\r\nIncludes information on modern biotechnological and molecular techniques and production technologies\r\nRelevant for international government, industrial and academic programs in research and development","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0cbf0674191a0b9aa543163ac0360c5356ce7579","amp;dn":"Breeding+Oilseed+Crops+for+Sustainable+Production","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0cbf0674191a0b9aa543163ac0360c5356ce7579","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,191,6,116,25,26,11,154,165,67,22,58,192,54,12,83,86,206,117,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
