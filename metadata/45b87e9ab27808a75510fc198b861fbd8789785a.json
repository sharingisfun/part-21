I will watch Congress applaud.  Again and Again.   I will watch so you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have to.\n\nThe State of the Union is at least an action of government that is required by the Constitution.  One of the few.  Article II, Section 3 says: Ã¢â‚¬Å“He shall from time to time give to Congress information of the State of the Union and recommend to their Consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nPresidents use the speech to give their vision for where America should go.  They make all sorts of promises.   They donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t keep them. My favorite quote from a State of the Union speech was from President Clinton in 1996: Ã¢â‚¬Å“The era of big government is over.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nCongress applauded.  But the following year, Congress increased spending by $9 billion. Today, Congress spends $1.4 TRILLION more than it spent the year that big government was supposedly over.\n\nRepublicans promise cuts, too.  In his 2006 speech, President G.W. Bush promised to cut 140 government programs and save taxpayers $14 billion.  He did, in fact, cut those programs.  So he didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t lie.  But his speech used the phrase Ã¢â‚¬Å“reduce or eliminate.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½   Bush mostly Ã¢â‚¬Å“reduced.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½  And not by much.  The $14 billion amounted to Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ 0.5% of the budget.  Whoopee.\n\nTonight I go live on FBN after the State of the Union and the Republican response from Paul Ryan.  My all-star libertarian panel will respond to the presidentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s speech.  Hearing the president give his State of the Union address makes me wonder:  what if I could set the agenda?   So IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll deliver my libertarian State of the Union.\n\nWeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re on at 11pm EST.  Live.  Makes me nervous!  IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m a stutterer.  At ABC, it was actually written into my contract:  Ã¢â‚¬Å“ABC News will not require Stossel to appear live.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½   Today, my stuttering is mostly under control.  At Fox, I do go live oftenÃ¢â‚¬Â¦but hosting a full hour after the President?  WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll see how that goes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:45b87e9ab27808a75510fc198b861fbd8789785a","amp;dn":"20110125-Stossel-%5BState+of+the+Union+-+Live+-+2011%5D.Fox.Business","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"45b87e9ab27808a75510fc198b861fbd8789785a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,184,126,154,178,120,8,167,85,16,252,25,139,134,31,189,135,137,120,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
