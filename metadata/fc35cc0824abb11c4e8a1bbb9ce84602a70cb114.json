It also adjust Y-FIX, so the screen will not come out crooked, or oblique. This program does not do ANYTHING, but finding the colour files, and convert them. This program has been a secret for some years now. All you have to do is to choose the iso file, Drag and Drop into this window, then press convert and it&amp;#039;s done. But remember to take a backup, before you convert, so if things doesn&amp;#039;t go right, you don&amp;#039;t have to download it again.\n\nThis is a real program!!! IT DOES WORK! I know the size looks a wee bit weird, but you don&amp;#039;t have to install this program, just click it and it will open.\n\nWorks on Win2000 and above (even Vista)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc35cc0824abb11c4e8a1bbb9ce84602a70cb114","amp;dn":"PS2+NTSC+to+PAL+or+PAL+to+NTSC+converter","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc35cc0824abb11c4e8a1bbb9ce84602a70cb114","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,53,204,8,36,171,177,28,78,138,27,187,156,232,70,2,167,12,177,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
