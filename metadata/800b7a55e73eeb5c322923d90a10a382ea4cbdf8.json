Under the dhimmi religious caste system, non-Muslims were subjected to legal and financial oppression, as well as social isolation. Extensive primary and secondary source materials, many translated here for the first time into English, are presented, making clear that jihad conquests were brutal, imperialist advances, which spurred waves of Muslims to expropriate a vast expanse of lands and subdue millions of indigenous peoples. Finally, the book examines how jihad war, as a permanent and uniquely Islamic institution, ultimately regulates the relations of Muslims with non-Muslims to this day. Scholars, educators, and interested lay readers will find this collection an invaluable resource.\n\nAuthor: Andrew Bostom\nPublisher: Prometheus Books\nPublication Date: July 10, 2008\n\nFormats:\n.epub (compatible with Sony Reader, Cruz Reader, iPad, iPodTouch/iPhone, etc.)\n.mobi (compatible with Amazon Kindle, etc.)\n\nFree Calibre eBook reader: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://calibre-ebook.com/download&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://calibre-ebook.com/download&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:800b7a55e73eeb5c322923d90a10a382ea4cbdf8","amp;dn":"Andrew+Bostom+-+The+Legacy+of+Jihad+%28mobi%2C+epub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"800b7a55e73eeb5c322923d90a10a382ea4cbdf8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,11,122,85,231,62,235,92,50,41,35,217,10,16,163,130,234,76,189,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
