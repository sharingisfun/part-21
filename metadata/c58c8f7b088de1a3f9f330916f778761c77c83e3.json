In their childhood they also had a close female friend in Anna Riley (Jenna Elfman) who leaves town as a child when her father gets a new job. Fast-forward to the present day and Jake is now Rabbi Jacob and Brian is now a Catholic Priest. They are both still the best of friends and are working on a project to bring their two religions together with a karaoke club.  \nAnna returns on the scene now a beautiful and glamorous career woman. At first all is well with the three of them, but soon both men fall in love with her. She falls in love with Jake and although they have an affair he can?t commit to her because she isn?t a Jew. Brian of course can?t do anything about his feelings for her because of his Catholic vows. As you can imagine this whole situation causes a serious strain on all the friendships, but love and friendship will conquer all in the end, or will it?\n\nDVD9 a DVD5: Dvd Decrypter + DVD Rebuilder + CCE (9 pass)\n\n- Reduction Level for DVD-5: 56,8%\n- Overall Bitrate : 3.320Kbs\n- Space for Video : 3.427.616KB\n- HIGH/LOW/TYPICAL Bitrates: 3.776/410/3.320 Kbs\n\nBen Stiller&amp;#039;s Cycle at www.solodvd.org\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c58c8f7b088de1a3f9f330916f778761c77c83e3","amp;dn":"Keeping+the+Faith","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c58c8f7b088de1a3f9f330916f778761c77c83e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,140,143,123,8,141,225,163,249,243,48,145,111,119,135,97,199,124,131,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
