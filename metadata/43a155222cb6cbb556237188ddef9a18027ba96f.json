Between The Times And The Tides is his first stab at something approaching a straight up rock album (although not his first solo project) but before a note is even played it is being contextualised by the divorce of hisSonic Youth bandmates Kim Gordon and Thurston Moore. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fair to say that Ranaldo's place in Sonic Youth was somewhat obscured by the presence of Gordon and Moore, so it must be somewhat galling to find them inadvertently providing context and a drama laden backdrop for RanaldoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s latest effort.\n\nDespite Moore and GordonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s songwriting stranglehold on Sonic Youth it was quite often the Ranaldo led songs that were the most impressive, Karen Revisited, EricÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Trip or Skip Tracer for example. With those compositions in mind, an album of Ranaldo songs that arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t avant sonic experiments is a pretty exciting prospect. It would be unfair to expect Between The Times And The Tides to scale the heights of Daydream Nation era Sonic Youth, but it is by no means a bad album.\n\n\ncd rippped by X Lossless Decoder version 20120226 (139.1)\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2012/05/20/4677/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2012/05/20/4677/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43a155222cb6cbb556237188ddef9a18027ba96f","amp;dn":"Lee+Ranaldo...Between+The+Times+%26amp%3B+The+Tides%282012%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43a155222cb6cbb556237188ddef9a18027ba96f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,161,85,34,44,182,203,181,86,35,113,136,221,239,154,24,2,123,169,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
