Much of it's previously unreleased, or extremely hard to locate. It's not just a collection of fan-oriented odds and ends, though. The material, for one thing, is extremely diverse, ranging from collaborations with Captain Beefheart and primitive teenage garage recordings to comic dialog to progressive instrumentals and orchestral pieces. The pre-Freak Out stuff in particular is revelatory, in the sense that it finds Zappa's sophisticated compositional and arrangement skills in full bloom years before he made his proper debut. There's also good old rock and roll, in an early version of &quot;Any Way the Wind Blows,&quot; and an early '60s take of &quot;Fountain of Love&quot; with explosive fuzz bass. The cuts range in duration from 11 seconds to 11 minutes, often connected by amusing bits of spoken patter or nifty instrumental links. The effect is somewhat like Uncle Meat or Lumpy Gravy, meaning that those who appreciate that period of Zappa's evolution will find an immediate affinity with this anthology. \n\n\n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tFlac (Lossless)\nAudiochecker:\t     \t99.83% CDDA\nLabel:\t\t\tRykodisc\nCatalog:\t\tRCD 40573\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.The Blackouts\n02.Lost In A Whirlpool\n03.Ronnie Sings\n04.Kenny's Booger Story\n05.Ronnie's Booger Story\n06.Mount St. Mary's Concert Excerpt\n07.Take Your Clothes Off When You Dance\n08.Tiger Roach\n09.Run Home Slow Theme\n10.Fountain Of Love\n11.Run Home Cues, #2\n12.Any Way The Wind Blows\n13.Run Home Cues, #3\n14.Charva\n15.The Dick Kunc Story\n16.Wedding Dress Song\n17.Handsome Cabin Boy\n18.Cops &amp; Buns\n19.The Big Squeeze\n20.I'm A Band Leader\n21.Alley Cat\n22.The Grand Wazoo\n23.Wonderful Wino\n24.Kung Fu\n25.RDNZL\n26.Basement Music #1\n27.Inca Roads\n28.Lil' Clanton Shuffle\n29.I Don't Wanna Get Drafted\n30.Sharleena\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for Seeding\nEnjoy...\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a9a140e5fbf28f7d00249ffd21c09c4dcf1e78c","amp;dn":"Frank+Zappa+-+The+Lost+Episodes+%281996%29+%5BFLAC%5D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a9a140e5fbf28f7d00249ffd21c09c4dcf1e78c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,154,20,14,95,191,40,247,208,2,73,255,210,28,9,196,220,241,231,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
