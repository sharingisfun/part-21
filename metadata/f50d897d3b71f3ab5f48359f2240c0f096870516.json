This virtual instrument,     \n             fashioned after the Sequential CircuitsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ ProphetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢-5,      \n          provides the sonic properties of the unique originals while  \n            meeting the practical requirements of the present day.     \n                                                                       \n          Inspired by the immortal sound of the synthesizer giants of  \n          the eighties, Native Instruments created the PRO-53 to cast  \n            in software those qualities that have been such a major    \n             influence on popular music in the past twenty years:      \n             brilliance, power, warmth and beauty. Through Native      \n              Instruments' creative development philosophy, these      \n          timeless aesthetics have now reached the next step in their  \n           evolution. The result is the manifest re-definition of an   \n              original that was regarded as unrivalled until now.      \n                                                                       \n                           PRO-53 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ The New Version                    \n          With the PRO-53, the third generation of the virtual analog  \n            classic is now available. The synthesizer emulation has    \n           been vastly improved by a new oscillator technology that    \n          offers an even warmer and more brilliant sound. In addition  \n            the sonic possibilities have been expanded even further    \n             with new features like a high-pass filter mode and an     \n           invertible filter envelope. The control surface was also    \n                reworked and now shines in a whole new light.          \n                                                                       \n           Using Native Instruments' highly advanced NSP-Technology    \n            (Native Signal Processing) it is possible to generate a    \n            software synthesizer that rivals its legendary hardware    \n             predecessors. The Native Instruments PRO-53 sets new      \n                    standards without denying its origins.             \n           What's new: no fixed limit to the number of voices, many    \n             more savable preset slots, velocity sensitivity, MIDI     \n             automation of all available parameters, an additional     \n          effects section, a high-pass filter mode, invertible filter  \n            envelope, audio input, LFO-envelope retrigger, and the     \n                  option to run several PRO-53s in parallel.           \n                                                                       \n           The PRO-53 is able to import Prophet-5ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ SysEx sound data,   \n           which means it can read and accurately reproduce all the    \n          existing sound libraries made for the original. The subtle   \n            deviations from perfect behaviour, which are typical of    \n             analog circuits and crucial to the sound, can now be      \n                                  fine-tuned.                          \n                                                                       \n          The huge sound library gives the PRO-53 plenty of material   \n           for all kinds of musical styles: 512 selected classic and   \n                  modern analog sounds cover any possibility.          \n            64 of these sounds have already been programmed for the    \n           previous version by synthesizer legend John Bowen, one of   \n           the creators of the ProphetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢-5 synthesizer. In addition,    \n              PRO-53 comes with 64 new sound presets, which were       \n        specially designed to take advantage of PRO-53's new features. \n                                                                       \n           512 preset memory slots are available where you can store   \n           your own sound creations. The PRO-53 displays a name for    \n              each of the presets, unlike the original which only      \n                         displayed the preset number.                  \n                                                                       \n                                    Effects                            \n                                                                       \n             A built-in effects unit adds multi-echo and ultra-fat     \n           chorus and flanging effects. This makes the sound of the    \n            PRO-53 'complete' for both live performance and studio     \n           production. The included preset sounds make extensive use   \n            of the effects. The PRO-53 also has an audio input for     \n           processing external audio signals through its filters and   \n                                   effects.                            \n                                                                       \n                                  Integration                          \n          The Native Instruments PRO-53 integrates perfectly into any  \n          computer based virtual studio by supporting the interfaces   \n            VSTÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â®, Audio UnitsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢, DXiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ and RTASÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢. It can be used as a    \n           sequencer plug-in or as a stand-alone synthesizer. It is    \n         possible to run several PRO-53 plug-in instances in parallel. \n                                                                       \n                                 Top Features                          \n                                                                       \n                 * Authentic emulation of the legendary Prophet-5ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢     \n                              analog synthesizer                       \n             * 576 selected classic and modern analog sounds included  \n               * 2 oscillators per voice, choice of pulse, triangle    \n                            and saw-tooth waveforms                    \n                      * Oscillator detune and synchronization          \n                  * 24dB low-pass filter with resonance and self       \n                 oscillation, additional high-pass filter mode         \n               * ADSR envelopes for amplitude and filter, invertible   \n                                filter envelope                        \n                * Low Frequency Oscillator with numerous modulation    \n                   options, LFO-envelope retrigger function            \n            * Fully compatible with ProphetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢-5 MIDI-SysEx program data \n                        * Input for external audio signals             \n                   * Effects unit for chorus, flanging and echo,       \n                                 MIDI-syncable                         \n                                                                       \n                           Import and Compatibility                    \n                           SysEx Data of Prophet-5ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢  \n===================================================================================\n\n1.
