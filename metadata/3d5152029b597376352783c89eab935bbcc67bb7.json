Between the composer\r\nand the improviser? Between the jazz and whatâ€™s beyond category? Much to the\r\nguitaristâ€™s credit, the answers are almost always elusive, as is the case with\r\nSamuel, Fieldsâ€™ second collection of compositions drawn from the texts of\r\nSamuel Beckett. Given that, as measured in discographical time, the album comes\r\non the heels of Beckett â€“ the 2006 Clean Feed collection also featuring Fieldsâ€™\r\nquartet with tenor saxophonist Matthias Schubert, cellist Scott Roller and\r\npercussionist John Hollenbeck â€“ spinning this more innocuously titled album\r\nwithout making the connection is not surprising. The music is sufficiently\r\ncompelling to initially keep the booklet with Dan Warburtonâ€™s informative notes\r\noff to the side. The quartet has an incisive bead on the material; their\r\nensembles are bristling; and their ability to sustain the finely calibrated\r\ndevelopment of the materials in three contrasting pieces of 20 to 25 minutes in\r\nduration reflects an exemplary, collectively honed discipline. Sure, knowing\r\nFields painstakingly ascribed pitch and duration values to Beckettâ€™s texts\r\nfacilitates a fuller reception of the work; yet, it is not required to dig the\r\njagged and jangling materials. It certainly explains the ensembleâ€™s aversion to\r\nlustrous decay; in conveying the bluntness of expression fundamental to\r\nBeckettâ€™s texts, their dampened attack and clipped phrases establishes a\r\ntemperamental continuity that is as essential to the music as adherence to the\r\nscores and the parameters for improvisation. This tints materials that would\r\notherwise be more easily compared to the graying generation of Midwestern\r\nstructuralist composers (although Fields has lived in Cologne since 2003,\r\nChicago is still discernable in his music). Still, the ensembleâ€™s\r\nfastidiousness in articulating Fieldsâ€™ compositions does not diminish the\r\nindividualism of the players; on the contrary, these are among the more\r\nengaging performances to date by Fields himself and by Schubert and Hollenbeck,\r\nthe more widely documented of his cohorts (the guitarist-like dexterity of\r\nRollerâ€™s pizzicato always prompts a desire to hear more). This is another\r\nsignificant recording by Fields.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nScott Fields \nhttp://www.scottfields.com/samuel.html\r\n\r\nBy FranÃ§ois Couture \nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/samuel-mw0000822807\r\n\r\nBy Troy Collins \nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/samuel-scott-fields-new-world-records-review-by-troy-collins.php","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d5152029b597376352783c89eab935bbcc67bb7","amp;dn":"Scott+Fields+Ensemble+-+Samuel+%282009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d5152029b597376352783c89eab935bbcc67bb7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,81,82,2,155,89,115,118,53,39,131,200,158,171,147,91,188,198,123,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
