Attilla&amp;#039;s \nelectronics and drumming are accompanied by Murat Yucel on electric \nand classic guitars. \n\nOf Turkish ancestry, Can Atilla explores New Age electronic (EM) \nterritory in the footsteps of Tangerine Dream and Jean Michel Jarre, \nflavoring those influences with his own uniquely lively sensibilities.\n\nDense keyboards belt out rapidly structured riffs with a frenetic \npassion, immediately drenching the audience with melodies that surge \nand cascade full of vigor and stamina. Sequencing provides lavish, \ngrowling underlayers for the emphatic keyboards. A variety of clever \nelectronic effects flavor the music with astral airs.\n\nPowerful percussion swiftly propels the music to epic proportions, \nadding larger-than-life rhythms that explode with authority. A sense of \ncompelling grandeur is achieved, a majesty that expands with each \npassing minute.\n\nFiery guitar-work embellishes the already hyperactive music, injecting \nardent fury and cosmic demeanor.\n\nPossessing strong Tangerine Dream influences, Atilla forces an \nescalation of dazzle from those roots, generating tuneage that is huge \nand impressively masterful. His audience reels before the sheer power \nof his music, dazed by its commanding presence and entranced by its \nengaging melodies.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n:: Generated by Music NFO Builder v1.17 - www.nfobuilder.com ::\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ffb14f8d826daf1c8521dcb6df1164c42435d991","amp;dn":"Can+Atilla+-+Live+%28New+Age+2003%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ffb14f8d826daf1c8521dcb6df1164c42435d991","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,177,79,141,130,109,175,28,133,33,220,182,223,17,100,196,36,53,217,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
