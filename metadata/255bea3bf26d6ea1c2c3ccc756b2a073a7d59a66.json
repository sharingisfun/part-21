Before they were household names, she wore Ferragamo pumps, carried Gucci bags and wore the designs of Oleg Cassini, Norman Norell, Emilio Pucci and Jean Louis. In an era of Peter Pan collars, poodle skirts, and repressed sexuality, MarilynÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sexy style and ability to spot up-and-coming designers made her a fashion visionary.\n\nMarilyn in Fashion traces the evolution of her style, from wholesome sweetness early in her career, to sex kitten looks in the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ50s, to elegant sophistication in the last years of her life. The text details the designers of her ensembles, where she wore them, and their influence on fashion. Behind-the-scenes stories reveal how the star often worked closely with designers to create looks befitting the Marilyn Monroe image. Illustrated with hundreds of rare and never-before-published photos, Marilyn in Fashion fabulously traces the style evolution of the ultimate Hollywood icon","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:255bea3bf26d6ea1c2c3ccc756b2a073a7d59a66","amp;dn":"Marilyn+in+Fashion+-+Christopher+Nickens+%26amp%3B+George+Zeno","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"255bea3bf26d6ea1c2c3ccc756b2a073a7d59a66","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,91,234,59,242,109,110,161,194,195,204,199,86,178,160,115,167,213,154,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
