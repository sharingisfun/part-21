Continuing a trend that would conclude with the band's fifth studio release, the lineup for the album was different from the previous one, as Land of the Free was the first Gamma Ray album to be released since the departure of Ralf Scheepers, leaving Kai Hansen to take up lead vocals. While not his first stint as a vocalist (Hansen had sung lead for Helloween until 1987 and had also recorded lead vocals on &quot;Heal Me&quot; from Insanity and Genius), it would be the first time he had performed lead vocals exclusively in 8 years.\n\nAdditionally, bassist Jan Rubach was to swap positions with guitarist Dirk SchlÃƒÂ¤chter. Rubach initially agreed, but then resisted making the move. Rubach and drummer Thomas Nack instead decided to leave Gamma Ray. Rubach left towards the tail end of Men on a Tour; SchlÃƒÂ¤chter took over the bass duties and Henjo Richter took over as the second guitarist. Nack would complete the tour and then leave, with both Rubach and Nack rejoining their former band Anesthesia.\n\nMichael Kiske (ex-Helloween) and Hansi KÃƒÂ¼rsch (Blind Guardian) were featured on the album as guest vocalists.\n\nMP3 - 320kbs\n  \nNo. \t\t\n1. \t&quot;Rebellion in Dreamland&quot;    \t                8:44\n2. \t&quot;Man on a Mission&quot;   \t\t                5:49\n3. \t&quot;Fairytale&quot;   \t  \t                        0:50\n4. \t&quot;All of the Damned&quot;                     \t5:00\n5. \t&quot;Rising of the Damned&quot;                  \t0:43\n6. \t&quot;Gods of Deliverance&quot;   \t         \t5:01\n7. \t&quot;Farewell&quot;   \t                                5:11\n8. \t&quot;Salvation's Calling&quot;   \t        \t4:36\n9. \t&quot;Land of the Free&quot;   \t                \t4:38\n10. \t&quot;The Saviour&quot;   \t                \t0:40\n11. \t&quot;Abyss of the Void&quot;    \t                        6:04\n12. \t&quot;Time to Break Free&quot;                      \t4:40\n13. \t&quot;Afterlife&quot;  \t                                4:46\n\n+ (2003) Bonus Tracks\n\n14. \t&quot;Heavy Metal Mania&quot; (Holocaust cover)    \t4:49\n15. \t&quot;As Time Goes By&quot; (pre-production version) \t4:53\n16. \t&quot;The Silence '95&quot;   \t                 \t6:29\n\n\nPlease Dont Hit And Run !\n\nAnd Please Feel free to Comment, Reguest and tell me what you like :D","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9c5918c8307e79426d4e5855ef1e97dd8eb58cb","amp;dn":"Gamma+Ray-1995-Land+Of+The+Free+%5B320kbs%5D+%7E%7ERenovatio%7E%7E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9c5918c8307e79426d4e5855ef1e97dd8eb58cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,197,145,140,131,7,231,148,38,212,229,133,94,241,233,125,216,235,88,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
