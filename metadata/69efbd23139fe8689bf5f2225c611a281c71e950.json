Not any more.  Today, the unemployment rate for young people in this country is close to 15% Ã¢â‚¬â€œ double that of the general population.  But the real crisis is the increasing number of university and college grads who are underemployed Ã¢â‚¬â€œ scraping by on low-paid, part-time jobs that donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t require a degree.  Although there are no official statistics in Canada, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s estimated that after graduating, one in three 25 to 29 year olds with a college or university degree ends up in a low-skilled job.  And to make things worse, 60% graduate with an average debt of $27,000.  Mired in debt, and working in dead end jobs, their launch into adulthood is being curtailed.  Some call them Ã¢â‚¬Å“the lost generationÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.  But, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not only young people who may be lost.  If the next generation fails to gain a toehold into the economy, who'll buy boomerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s houses?  WhoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll pay for social programs? Youth unemployment and underemployment is a ticking time bomb with serious consequences for everyone.\n\nGENERATION JOBLESS delves into why so many young Canadians are overeducated and underemployed.  The reality is that todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s twenty-somethingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s are entering  an economy in the throes of a seismic shift where globalization and technology are transforming the workplace. Automation is replacing tens of thousands of jobs at a time.  Companies fixated on the bottom line are outsourcing jobs and wherever possible getting computers to do the work.  Employers are placing a higher premium on experienced workers, unwilling to invest in training new entrants to the workforce. So, young people are caught in a catch 22.  How do you get experience if no one will hire you without it? Many are working for free as unpaid interns, just to try and get their foot in the door.  And, for the first time in history youth are facing another unique challenge  Ã¢â‚¬â€œ competition with their parentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ generation for the small pool of jobs that do exist. Boomers who are delaying retirement.  \n\nBy all accounts the problem is only going to get worse.  Especially since the key players in Canada Ã¢â‚¬â€œuniversities, employers and governments Ã¢â‚¬â€œ are not working together to find a solution.  Canada is the only country in the world without a national body responsible for  education and is seen as one of the most decentralized and fragmented countries in the world when it comes to helping young people make a smooth entry into the world of work. \n\nSeveral experts weigh in on what many are calling the most important social issue of our time Ã¢â‚¬â€œ including Francis Fong, TD Bank Economist and author of the report The Plight of Younger Workers that paints a bleak picture of youth employment in Canada; Armine Yalnizyan Sr. Economist, Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives who has been tracking trends in the labour market for two decades; and Dr. Paul Cappon, former head of the Canadian Council on Learning a research and advocacy program focused on learning in Canada; \n\nThe documentary takes viewers to Switzerland where the youth unemployment rate is 2.8% - the lowest in the developed world.  Here the idea of young people graduating with degrees and unable to find jobs is virtually unheard of.  Dr. Stefan Wolter, Director of the Coordination Centre For Research In Education, explains how all levels of government, educators and employers, work together to ensure that education and training are linked to employment.\n\nGENERATION JOBLESS is directed by Sharon Bartlett and Maria LeRose, who also produced the documentary with Sue Ridout for Dreamfilm Productions with the participation on CBC-TV\n\nContract Dreamfilm Productions to purchase a copy of this film for home use.\n\n\nShow description:\nDOC ZONE is CBC's flagship documentary series that presents a sweeping panoramic view of what matters most to Canadians.\n\n\n\n\n--- File Information ---                                                        \nFile Name        : Doc.Zone.2013-01-31.Generation.Jobless.HDTV.x264-CLDD.mp4\nFormat            : MPEG-4 at 761 Kbps\nLength            : 245 MiB for 45mn 1s 132ms\n\nVideo #0          : AVC at 602 Kbps\nAspect            : 720 x 400 (1.800) at 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AAC at 155 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage          : en\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69efbd23139fe8689bf5f2225c611a281c71e950","amp;dn":"Doc.Zone.2013-01-31.Generation.Jobless.HDTV.x264-CLDD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69efbd23139fe8689bf5f2225c611a281c71e950","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,239,189,35,19,159,232,104,155,245,242,34,92,97,26,40,28,113,233,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
