The twists and\n    turns of the alleyways turn every corner into a close-quarters\n    deathtrap\n    Palace: There's no time for reflection even in this magnificent\n    relic. What once was a museum dedicated to showing the glories of the\n    past is now a battlefield, with a massive courtyard at the heart of\n    its contested ground\n    Transit: A Moscow metro station makes for close quarters and\n    close-range combat. Trains pulling into and out of the station add to\n    the danger as Ghosts and Bodark slug it out underground\n    \n    One new multiplayer game mode: Takeover\n    Similar to a classic team deathmatch, score points for your team by\n    eliminating enemies. Tip the scales by taking control of the enemy's\n    objective and earn a score multiplier for your team. Defend your\n    team's objective to prevent the enemy from gaining the same advantage\n    Choose to split your team to defend and attack at the same time, or\n    move as a group and overwhelm your enemy. When the mission ends, the\n    team with the highest score wins\n    \n    One Guerrilla Mode map Village (four players online / two players in\n    local split screen)\n    \n    A peaceful country village finds itself transformed into a\n    battleground, as fighting rages around its central bus station. Long\n    alleyways that run between war-damaged buildings make a perfect\n    hunting ground for snipers, and a shootout near the town's gas station\n    could turn explosive\n    \n    Level cap increase of +10\n    \n    INSTALL NOTES\n    \n    1.
