A jewel of the American Industrial Revolution, in the hands of its foundersÃ¢â‚¬â€the sometimes reckless and always boisterous Busch family of St. Louis, MissouriÃ¢â‚¬â€it grew into one of the most fearsome marketing machines in modern times. In Bitter Brew, critically acclaimed journalist Knoedelseder paints a fascinating portrait of immense wealth and power accompanied by a barrelful of scandal, heartbreak, tragedy, and untimely death.\n\nThis engrossing, vivid narrative captures the Busch saga through five generations. At the same time, it weaves a broader story of American progress and decline over the past 150 years. It's a cautionary tale of prosperity, hubris, and loss.\nebook, 416 pages\nPublished November 6th 2012 by HarperBusiness (first published August 14th 2012)\nISBN 0062096680 (ISBN13: 9780062096685)\nedition language English\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15819273-bitter-brew&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15819273-bitter-brew&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a872047d8e2175e829f1e40126ad7c4c61828900","amp;dn":"Bitter+Brew%3A+The+Rise+and+Fall+of+Anheuser-Busch+and+America%27s+K","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a872047d8e2175e829f1e40126ad7c4c61828900","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,114,4,125,142,33,117,232,41,241,228,1,38,173,124,76,97,130,137,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
