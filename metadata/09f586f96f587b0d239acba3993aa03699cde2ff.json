Griffin is a single guy who loves his job at the Franklin Park Zoo. He has a special bond with the animals, yet he can't help but feel lonely each night when he returns to an empty house. Eventually deciding that a more prestigious job may be the key to finding a new girlfriend, Griffin prepares to turn in his walking papers and reinvent himself. But when word gets out to the animals that Griffin will soon be leaving, they realize the only way to keep him around is to reveal they have the gift of the gab. Perhaps with a little dating advice from his friends in the animal kingdom, this lonely zookeeper will manage to meet the girl of his dreams without losing the job he loves. Rosario Dawson co-stars in a comedy featuring the voices of Sylvester Stallone, Adam Sandler, Cher, and Nick Nolte.\n\n\nCast :\nKevin James . Griffin Keyes\nRosario Dawson . Kate\nLeslie Bibb .

Doing so reduces the strain on the CPU and allows for \n even High Definition content to be played on a relatively weak system. \n\n\nAudio Info : \n- Format/Info......: AC-3  (Audio Coding 3)\n- Format profile...: CM (complete main)\n- Bit rate.........: 448 Kbps\n- Channel(s).......: 6 channels   \n- Channel positions: Front: L C R, Side: L R, LFE\n- Sampling rate....: 48.0 KHz   \n\n\n\n\n\n # Cheers to the support for this release by  : http://www.chociz.com/\n # Follow the Releases from   :\n\n [img]http://torrent-stats.info/cba3/13a8f2f96.png[/img]\n \n  \n  \n # QUALiTY AT iT's BEST #\n      \n\t  M  X  M  G\n\n[IMG]http://lookpic.com/c1/i2/1336/v1jTC2Qo.png[/IMG]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09f586f96f587b0d239acba3993aa03699cde2ff","amp;dn":"Zookeeper+2011+BRRip+720p+x264+DXVA-MXMG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09f586f96f587b0d239acba3993aa03699cde2ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,245,134,249,111,88,123,13,35,154,203,163,153,58,160,54,153,205,226,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
