Boxee is a fork of the free and open source XBMC media center software which Boxee uses as an application framework for its GUI and media player core platform, together with some custom and proprietary additions.\n\nMarketed as the first ever &quot;Social Media Center&quot;, Boxee enables its users to view, rate and recommend content to their friends through many social network services and interactive media related features.\n\nBoxee supports a wide range of multimedia formats and includes features such as playlists, audio visualizations, slideshows, weather forecasts reporting, and an expanding array of third-party plugins. As a media center, Boxee can play most audio and video file formats, as well as display images from many sources, including CD/DVD-ROM drives, USB flash drives, the Internet, and local area network shares.\n\nThrough the processing power of modern PC hardware, Boxee is able to decode high-definition video up to 1080p. Boxee is able to use Nvidia's VDPAU on Linux-based operating-systems, and DXVA (DirectX Video Acceleration) on Windows Vista and newer Microsoft operating-systems to utilize GPU accelerated video decoding to assist with process of video decoding of high-definition videos.\n\nWith its Python plugin system, Boxee includes incorporated add-on features such as Apple movie trailer support and subtitle downloading, as well as online internet content channels and services, like BBC iPlayer, Jamendo, Joost, Last.fm, NPR, SHOUTcast internet audio plugins, ABC,CNET, CNN, CBS, Comedy Central, MTV Music, MySpaceTV, Netflix, Revision3, YouTube, The WB Television Network internet video plugins, and Flickr and PicasaWeb picture viewing plugins. All are available as media sources available alongside the local library.\n\n\n-What are the minimum system requirements to run Boxee?\n\n\nBoxee can probably run on anything, but the things that it will run well on:\n* x86 (Intel/AMD processor) based system running at 1.0GHz or greater\n* 512MB system memory (RAM) or more\n\nGraphics controller / card / adapter and device drivers capable of\n* OpenGL 1.4 (+ GLSL) or higher (please read this for further info regarding Boxee and OpenGL).\n* 32-bit colors or more\n\nBoxee currently runs on the following systems:\n* Mac OS X 10.4 or higher (Intel processor based only)\n* Linux (ubuntu 32-bit or 64-bit) 8.04 or higher\n* Windows XP or Vista ,Windows 7 (64-bit x86 is not officially supported)\n\n\n-What's New:\n\nVersion 1.5 of Boxee is currently being tested by Boxee Box Early Access users and will soon be available in Beta. We plan to release 1.5 together with Live TV later in January. HereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s some of the new features you can look forward to on the Boxee BoxÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\n\nHome Screen\nWeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve added links to the standard menu to launch the Browser and Live TV (once youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve attached the dongle). We also gave the featured section a small facelift.\n\nMenu\nThe Menu is now more accessible, popping up as an overlay that lets you quickly navigate between different sections or search. we also optimized search to minimize the number of clicks.\n\nMovies &amp; TV Shows\nWe updated the layout of Movies and TV Shows for easier navigation by Genre and Source as well as providing quick access to trailers.\nThere is also a new Movie details screen with extended synopsis and cast &amp; crew information. For TV Shows it is now much easier to jump between seasons and see which episodes you already watched.\n\nWatch Later &amp; Friends\nWe expanded the thumbnails in Watch Later &amp; Friends sections and now let you filter between clips, TV Shows and Movies.\n\n\nThank you - Karlocool","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c215b9089ad2dba505c91e6d8d3f922f4cea5d4d","amp;dn":"boxee+1.5.0.23267+++%5BPC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c215b9089ad2dba505c91e6d8d3f922f4cea5d4d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,21,185,8,154,210,219,165,5,201,30,109,141,63,146,47,76,234,93,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
