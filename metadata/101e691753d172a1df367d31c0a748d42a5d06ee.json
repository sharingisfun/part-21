In its two previous editions this book has proved to be an accessible and balanced introduction to modern particle physics, suitable for those students needed a more comprehensive introduction to the subject than provided by the Ã¢â‚¬ËœcompendiumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ style physics books.\n\nIn the Third Edition the standard model of particle physics is carefully developed whilst unnecessary mathematical formalism is avoided where possible. Emphasis is placed on the interpretation of experimental data in terms of the basic properties of quarks and leptons.\n\nOne of the major developments of the past decade has been the establishing of the existence of neutrino oscillations. This will have a profound effect on the plans of experimentalists. This latest edition brings the text fully up-to-date, and includes new sections on neutrino physics, as well as expanded coverage of detectors, such as the LHC detector.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:101e691753d172a1df367d31c0a748d42a5d06ee","amp;dn":"PPTest","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"101e691753d172a1df367d31c0a748d42a5d06ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,30,105,23,83,209,114,161,223,54,125,49,192,167,72,212,42,93,6,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
