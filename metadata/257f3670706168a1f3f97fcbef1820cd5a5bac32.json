Lidsky,  L. Ovsyannikov, A. Tuliakov and M. Shabunin.\n\n\nThis book is written by a group of Soviet mathematicians under the guidance of Professor Victor Lidsky D.Sc. (Phys. &amp; Maths). It includes advanced problems in elementary mathematics with hints and solutions.\n\nIn each section - algebra, geometry and trigonometry - the problems are arranged in the order of increasing difficulty. There are 658 problems in all.\n\nThe text can be used in mathematical schools and school mathematical societies.\n\nThis book was translated from the Russian by V. Vosolov and was first published by Mir Publishers in 1973.\n\nAll credits to the original uploader.\n\nA note on the quality of the book: When the book was picked up from the net, it needed cleaning. We did the cleaning (somewhat), OCR and bookmarking.\n\nPDF | OCR | Cover | Bookmarked | 25.5 MB | 382 pages | Paginated\n\n======================================\n=++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++=\n=+                                  +=\n=+ Released on TPB by mirtitles.org +=\n=+                                  +=\n=++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++=\n======================================\t\n\n\nCONTENTS\nAlgebra\nProblems / Solutions\n1.
