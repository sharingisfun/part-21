After hearing about the wish-granting Stony Cat, he decides to try and make an offering to lose his facade, only to meet Tsukiko who wishes instead to be more discreet with her feelings to become more adultlike. Who'd have thought the rumors of the wish-granting Stony Cat turns out to be true; transferring the facade that YÃ…ï¿½to wishes to lose into a classmate who needs it more and making it difficult for Tsukiko to show even the slightest of emotions on her face.
