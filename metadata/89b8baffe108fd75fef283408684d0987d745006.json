Really, I ain't joking. I really don't know what the deal is with this Spears chick, but I'm telling you, Mandy is NOTHING at all like her. Her songs are more meaningful, upbeat and...good. She has songs that will keep you humming to the tune for days. (Trust me) I'm going to be honest to all you music-lovers, out of all the eleven songs I heard, I liked...all of THEM. Finally, an album where I enjoy listening to all the songs in the track. Now, of course, I'm a person that enjoys listening to pop. Please, don't buy this cd if you like listening to Korn or Hole, or something like that. It's just not for you. I have absolutely no regrets buying this cd. It's the best. And you're talking to an experienced person here. So go on and buy the album, and try it and see. Really. Go do it. Now.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:89b8baffe108fd75fef283408684d0987d745006","amp;dn":"Mandy+Moore+-+So+Real+320cbr+%28Big+Papi%29+1999","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"89b8baffe108fd75fef283408684d0987d745006","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,184,186,255,225,8,253,117,254,242,131,64,134,132,208,152,125,116,80,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
