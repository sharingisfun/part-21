During her stay, Ana also dedicated time to continue playing and learning the violin, the instrument that she had been taught since childhood. \nThat got her in contact with the traditional Ã¢â‚¬Ëœkeyed fiddleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ from Sweden: the Nyckelharpa, an instrument that combines a keyboard with tangents, like in the hurdy-gurdy, with the bow that frictions the strings, such as on a viol or a fiddle.\nAfter finishing her studies, she went back to Madrid and played her string instruments with a number of local folk and Celtic music bands. She also worked on her own musical projects, and since 2006 Ana has released two CDs and a DVD in cooperation with local and foreign musicians.\nSince 2006, Ana lives 70 km South of Madrid, in ToledoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s downtown. For someone interested on the Castilian, Sephardic and Medieval music.\no move to the nearby city of Toledo is a wise choice. \nThis city keeps a beautiful and extensive old town with stone buildings, narrow streets, churches, mosques and synagogues, providing the right atmosphere to concentrate and get inspired by the rich historical and cultural heritage of the place.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:24a71653cafe71a12d0c826a86d5fbb1a94b6291","amp;dn":"Ana+Alcaide+-+Nyckelharpa+-+La+Cantiga+Del+Fuego","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"24a71653cafe71a12d0c826a86d5fbb1a94b6291","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,167,22,83,202,254,113,161,45,12,130,106,134,213,251,177,169,75,98,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
