The middle of seven siblings, SherwinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s arrival into the world is nothing short of a miracle. His mother had fallen ill where doctors feared she had cancer. Thankfully tests turned up negative but it was discovered that Mrs. Gardner was 20 weeks into a pregnancy she was unaware of. She was advised to abort the fetus for fear that it would jeopardize her life or the baby would be born deformed. Despite several warnings from doctors, she refused to abort and Sherwin was born healthy and whole.\n\nBy the time he was five-years-old, he was singing and had taught himself the lyrics to Michael Jacksons, We are the World. From there his uncle, Kenny Patterson, took him in hand to prepare him for the stage. Sherwin made his public concert debut at the Himalaya Club, singing the Church classic He Touched Me.\n\nThe journey is only just beginning as he continues to break into as yet uncharted territories. More than just a singer or producer, Sherwin is a young man whose heart is focused on spreading the Good News of Jesus Christ. \n\nIn Him,\nTorrentTracts - July 2012\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8da264e6f33bc320eb7fa05daca912a18fdf06a8","amp;dn":"Sherwin+Gardner+Discography+2000-2012+%289+Releases%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8da264e6f33bc320eb7fa05daca912a18fdf06a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,162,100,230,243,59,195,32,235,127,160,93,172,169,18,161,143,223,6,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
