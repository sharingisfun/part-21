And by the encouragement of Chizuko, she overcomes various difficulties in her life.\n\n\n\n(A junior high school girl communicates with her dead sister in Nobuhiko Obayashi stunning fantasy drama. The 2Ã‚Â½ hour film hits the essence of adorable, yet manages strong character drama and heavy topics at the same. Idol Hikari Ishida is terrific in the lead role, in terms of both acting and coming up with one of the cutest performances ever seen in Japanese cinema. Joe HisaishiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s score, which sounds like lifted from Studio Ghibli movie, completes the package. Indeed, Futari is very much a live action Hayao Miazaki film if there ever was one Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and every bit as great as MiyazakiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best movies. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s almost a shame director Obayashi is internationally known only for his lesser (though classic) movies like House.)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:335bd51606ccce6dfcdd9989458519c17f159d23","amp;dn":"%E5%85%A9%E5%80%8B%E4%BA%BA%2FFutari%2FChizuko%27s+Younger+Sister%2F%E3%81%B5%E3%81%9F%E3%82%8A%2FUs+Two%2FTwo+of+Us%281991%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"335bd51606ccce6dfcdd9989458519c17f159d23","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,91,213,22,6,204,206,109,252,221,153,137,69,133,25,193,127,21,157,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
