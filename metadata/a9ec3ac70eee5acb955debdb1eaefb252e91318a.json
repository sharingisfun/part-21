As a result, she's struggling to grow up fast; wrestling with poverty, loneliness, and her Mom's illness every step of the way. Betty, Marie's Mom, can't help; she's living with an illness that's slowly getting worse and increasingly frightening, and she just doesn't have the resources left over at the end of the day to help Marie. With her Mom absorbed in her own problems, Marie is essentially alone while she learns to deal with the chaos in her young life. \n\nMarie's youth makes it that much harder for her to cope - as a teenager, she just doesn't have the life experience to feel confident about her decisions. At the start of the story, we see a scared young girl, uncertain and overwhelmed, but as Betty collapses into a full nervous breakdown, Marie is forced to examine herself and her life and come to a decision: does she continue to be a child, reacting to what's happening around her? Or does she take control of her life, come what may?\n\nWritten and Illustrated by Von Allan (http://www.vonallan.com)\n\n141 illustrated pages\n\nPDF format\n\nISBN: 9780978123703\n\nWritten and Illustrated by Von Allan","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9ec3ac70eee5acb955debdb1eaefb252e91318a","amp;dn":"The+road+to+god+knows...+graphic+novel+ebook+by+Von+Allan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9ec3ac70eee5acb955debdb1eaefb252e91318a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,236,58,199,14,238,90,203,149,93,235,219,30,174,251,37,46,145,49,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
