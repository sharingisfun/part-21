This was over on Demonoid and I thought it would be of great use here on The Piratebay!\n\nENJOY!!!\n\n\nRe-written from the ground up, and inspired by the older works of others, this new version of the utility will not only modify your hosts file, but it will also let you reset the file back to its default state if you've gotten yourself gummed up somewhere along the way.\n\nUse this utility BEFORE you install any Adobe application that uses activation technologies. You'll be able to do away with Little Snitch if you only use Adobe apps, as they won't ever know how to phone home!\n\n\nAnd remember: If you profit from the full software pack, be sure to buy it. M'kay? ;)\n\n~ ~ ~\n\nThis is an updated version of the utility I posted a few days prior. It has corrected any/all minor issues identified in the previous version, and incorporates better logic to boot.\n\nShould be compatible with all Adobe CS versions that use activation technologies ( CS5.5 / CS5 / CS4 / CS3 ), and should work on Mac OS X 10.7 Lion and earlier, all the way down to 10.2. \n\n\n***BIG THANKS TO SUPERSLACKER FOR WRITING THIS!!!***\n\n\nFOR MAS OS X ONLY!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:03066d74e47f1fc3c0ebb1b37e824c6896cc9e0b","amp;dn":"Adobe+Activation+Blocker+1.1+SS.zip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"03066d74e47f1fc3c0ebb1b37e824c6896cc9e0b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,6,109,116,228,127,31,195,192,235,177,179,126,130,76,104,150,204,158,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
