You wonder if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll make it out alive.\n\n\nAnd theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll tell you now, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re the lucky one.\nYeah, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll tell you now, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re the lucky one.\nCan you tell me now, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re the lucky one, oh, oh, oh.\n\nIt was a few years later, I showed up here.\nAnd they still tell the legend of how you disappeared,\nHow you took the money and your dignity, and got the hell out.\nThey say you bought a bunch of land somewhere,\nChose the Rose Garden over Madison Square,\nAnd it took some time, but I understand it now.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬ËœCause now my name is up in lights, but I think you got it right,\n\nLet me tell you now, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re the lucky one.\nLet me tell you now, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re the lucky one.\nLet me tell you now, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re the lucky one, oh, oh, oh.\n\nAnd theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll tell you now, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re the lucky one.\nYeah, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll tell you now, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re the lucky one.\nAnd theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll tell you now, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re the lucky one, oh, oh, oh.\nOh, whoa, oh, oh.\n\nThanks\n[img]http://kastatic.com/i2/userpics/824bade088c9791153165b4ab65e1512.gif[/img]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d525dbdf4da37dd99b142a42b8fcc6205ea2b630","amp;dn":"Taylor+Swift+-+The+Lucky+One.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d525dbdf4da37dd99b142a42b8fcc6205ea2b630","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,37,219,223,77,163,125,217,155,20,42,66,184,252,198,32,94,162,182,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
