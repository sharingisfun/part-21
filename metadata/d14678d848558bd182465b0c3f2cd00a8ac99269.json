He exposes in forensic detail both the formal government-to-government trade in arms and the shadow world of illicit weapons dealing, and lays bare the shockingly frequent links between the two. Drawing on his experience as a member of the African National Congress who resigned when the ANC refused to launch a corruption investigation into a major South African arms deal, Feinstein illuminates the impact this network has not only on conflicts around the world but also on the democratic institutions of the United States and the United Kingdom.\n\nBased on pathbreaking reporting and unprecedented access to top-secret information and major players in this clandestine realm,The Shadow World places us in the midst of the arms trades dramatic wheeling and dealingfrom corporate boardrooms to seedy out-of-the-way hotelsand reveals the profound danger and enormous financial cost this network represents to all of us.\n\n \n\nMP3 32kbps Unabridged.
