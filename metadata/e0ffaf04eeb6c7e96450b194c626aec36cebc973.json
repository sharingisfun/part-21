The magazine lasted 136 issues from 1989 to 2000. The magazine was formed when, in the wake of selling ACE to EMAP, Future split the dual-format title ST/Amiga Format into two separate publications (the other being ST Format). At the height of its success the magazines sold over 170,000 copies per month, topping 200,000 with its most successful ever issue.\r\n\r\nSee the included Readme.txt for source sites.\r\n\r\nThese (high quality) scans of Amiga Format magazine were compiled from existing scans from various sources.
