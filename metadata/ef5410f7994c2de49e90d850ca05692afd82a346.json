I mean really what more can you ask for?\n\n1-9 A Midsummernight's Dream, Op.61 by Felix Mendelssohn (play by William Shakespeare), performed by the Chamber Orchestra of Europe, conducted by Nikolaus Harnoncourt, released as Teldec CD in 1993.\n\n10-18 Egmont, Op.83 by Ludwig van Beethoven (play by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe), performed by the Orchestra of St. Luke's, conducted by Dennis Russell Davies, released as EMI Angel CD in 1990.\n\nThese are both complete copies of the respective recordings, though each was released on a CD with another work not included here.\n\nThe incidental music to Egmont is Beethoven's complete score for the work. The Mendelssohn music contains the highlights and more of his score for Midsummer Night's Dream, but there are bits and pieces not included on this recording.\n\nTogether the 2 recordings run 76 minutes, 46 seconds and fit comfortably together on one CD.\n\nScans of texts from the CD booklets included.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef5410f7994c2de49e90d850ca05692afd82a346","amp;dn":"Incidental+Music+by+Beethoven+and+Mendelssohn","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef5410f7994c2de49e90d850ca05692afd82a346","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,84,16,247,153,76,45,228,158,144,216,80,202,5,105,42,253,130,163,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
