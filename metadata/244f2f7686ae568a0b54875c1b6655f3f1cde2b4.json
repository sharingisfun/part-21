It has survived all manner of invective and unhealthy assumptions to become a shining example of music made because it needs to be, not because of anything the performers expect to get out of it. This is art which gets inside your heart.&quot;\nThe artists featured on this 3-CD, the most comprehensive of its kind, indeed created affecting music about what mattered to them, and what started as intense personal expression evolved into a &quot;lifestyle&quot; for the core audience that most embraced its dark ethos. Reveling in introspection and entranced with sex, death, poetry, and the life of the mind, Goth has a power to fascinate that has never waned.\nA Life Less Lived&amp;#039;s three audio CDs contain 53 essential Goth tracks, including Bauhaus&amp;#039; &quot;Bela Lugosi&amp;#039;s Dead,&quot; Sisters Of Mercy&amp;#039;s &quot;Temple Of Love,&quot; Virgin Prunes&amp;#039; &quot;Pagan Love Song,&quot; AFI&amp;#039;s &quot;The Hanging Garden,&quot; and many more.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:244f2f7686ae568a0b54875c1b6655f3f1cde2b4","amp;dn":"VA+-+A+Life+Less+Lived+The+Gothic+Box+%282006%29+%5B3CD%5D+%5Bmp3%40VBR%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"244f2f7686ae568a0b54875c1b6655f3f1cde2b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,79,47,118,134,174,86,138,11,84,135,92,27,102,85,243,241,205,226,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
