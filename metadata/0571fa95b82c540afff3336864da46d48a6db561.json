When its posted, we will all know.\nFourth, just because you have access to hbo.com or youtube, DOES NOT mean that everyone in the world does and this gives those people easy access to the material.\nFifth, I know haters will be haters, so keep doing your job because you are good, at least, in that.\n\nLASTLY, to all of you that appreciate these posts and have expressed this, THANK YOU and you're welcome. If it wasn't for all the people that enjoy these and have voiced it, I would've stopped doing these a long time ago.\n\nPeace\n\nShadoe","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0571fa95b82c540afff3336864da46d48a6db561","amp;dn":"Real.Time.With.Bill.Maher.JUST.OVERTIME.2013.10.25.WEB-DL.Shadoe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0571fa95b82c540afff3336864da46d48a6db561","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,113,250,149,184,44,84,10,255,243,51,104,100,218,70,212,138,109,181,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
