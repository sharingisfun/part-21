Some of these tracks haven't seen the light of day since Sub Pop released them through their brilliant singles club; others were on tribute albums and indie split 7&quot;s with severely limited distribution. The cover songs by such diverse artists as David Bowie, the Pixies, the Replacements, and (gulp) MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶tley CrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼e are fun (particularly their energetic version of the Cure's &quot;Close to Me&quot;), and somehow still manage to be stamped with the Kids' trademark sound. As is often the case with career-spanning collections, it is interesting to hear the shift from their mid-'90s straight punk-pop to their more indie rock/emo sound. While the whole CD doesn't hold together as strongly as their actual releases, longtime fans will be overjoyed to have all of these songs in one place.\n\nFormat: CD\nReleased: Nov 27, 2001\nLabel: Vagrant Records\nGenre: Rock\nStyle: Indie\nQuality: FLAC\n\nTracks:\n\n1.     &quot;Up On The Roof&quot;                                       2:44\n2.     &quot;Suffragette City (David Bowie Cover)&quot;                 3:20\n3.     &quot;Central Standard Time&quot;                                3:23\n4.     &quot;Close To Me (The Cure Cover)&quot;                         3:24\n5.     &quot;Forgive And Forget (Originally from Red Letter Day)&quot;  3:24\n6.     &quot;Regret (New Order Cover)&quot;                             5:00\n7.     &quot;Beer For Breakfast (The Replacements Cover)&quot;          1:37\n8.     &quot;Newfound Mass (2000) (Alternate version )&quot;            4:24\n9.     &quot;Alec Eiffel (Pixies Cover)&quot;                           3:01\n10.     &quot;Impossible Outcomes&quot;                                 3:31\n11.     &quot;On With the Show (MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶tley CrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼e Cover)&quot;                3:36\n12.     &quot;Ten Minutes (Demo)&quot;                                  3:05\n13.     &quot;Anne Arbour (Originally from Red Letter Day)&quot;        3:29\n14.     &quot;Burned Bridges (Coalesce cover)&quot;                     3:02\n15.     &quot;I'm A Loner Dottie, A Rebel (Demo)&quot;                  2:55\n16.     &quot;Shorty (Demo)&quot;                                       3:24\n17.     &quot;The Breathing Method (B-Side from &quot;Shorty&quot;)&quot;         4:44\n\nUploaded by politux.
