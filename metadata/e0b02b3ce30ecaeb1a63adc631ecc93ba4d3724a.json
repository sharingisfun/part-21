As such, the quality is not that great - there is a light ringing and fairly substantial saturation and distortion.  Consider this an FM broadcast-quality showcase of Tomorrow's Harvest for you to get a feel for it so you can place an order for the album if you like it. \n\nIf you complain and demand a CD rip then you are not a true Boards of Canada fan. \n\n---\n\n[* Track One is missing]Gemini\nReach For The Dead\nWhite Cyclosa\nJacquard Causeway\nTelepath\nCold Earth\nTransmisiones Ferox\nSick Times\nCollapse\nPalace Posy\nSplit Your Infinities\nUritual\nNothing Is Real\nSundown\nNew Seeds\nCome To Dust\nSemena Mertvykh\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0b02b3ce30ecaeb1a63adc631ecc93ba4d3724a","amp;dn":"Boards+of+Canada+-+Tomorrow%27s+Harvest+%5Blive+transmission+bootleg","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0b02b3ce30ecaeb1a63adc631ecc93ba4d3724a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,176,43,60,227,14,202,235,26,99,173,198,49,236,201,59,164,211,114,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
