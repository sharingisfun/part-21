You may find http://new.cseti.org/ambassador-trainings.html of interest.\n\nThe app was designed to be used in the field where Internet connectivity is not available. However when the app is run for the first time, it requires Internet access to download the media file (just over 110MB, you get a lot of great content). Also, there are links in the text provided in the app that link to external websites that require Internet access to use.\n\nNOTE: The media file download that happens when the app is run for the first time can, depending on your data plan, incur additional charges. If this is your case, we recommend you defer purchasing this app until you are in an area where you have unmetered or lower cost Internet access (such as home or office WiFi connectivity). In any case, neither Outer World Apps nor CSETI is responsible for any additional charges.\n\n\nOfficial Dr. Steven Greer material!\n\nJust download and install! Already licensed!\n\n\nPLEASE SEED!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05636ae6c6723591c9852e6a44e9eff09abb1df8","amp;dn":"ET+Contact+Tool+v.+1.0.4+PRELICENSED","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05636ae6c6723591c9852e6a44e9eff09abb1df8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,99,106,230,198,114,53,145,201,133,46,106,68,233,239,240,154,187,29,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
