The artwork is stunning, and the story line an original masterpiece.\n\nThe plotline of this story is simple.\n\nYou enslave a race of beings and take them for granted, one of them eventually learns your language, and unites all his fellow slaves in an organized attack.\n\nSuddenly you&amp;#039;ve been conquered.\n\nThis story line was later ripped off by L. Ron Hubbard and his group of wackos. You might have read the book, or seen the atrocity of a film &quot;Battlefield Earth&quot;.\n\nformat: AVI\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c9861869a5aa7f1ce8b80aad3d7a5c331f295ac","amp;dn":"fantastic+planet+-+full+cartoon+movie+-+trippy+-+256kb+-+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c9861869a5aa7f1ce8b80aad3d7a5c331f295ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,152,97,134,154,90,167,241,206,139,128,170,211,215,165,195,49,242,149,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
