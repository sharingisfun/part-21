The ensemble sections are polished, and the CD sound is wonderful. But the Catingub originals are very derivative, and the band lacks the great soloist that can rise above the fray and elevate the orchestra in the process. Mavis Rivers contributes some enthusiastic vocals. (AllMusic)\n\nTrack list:\n01 - I'm Getting Cement All Over Ewe\n02 - Even More Blues, But My Abscessed Tooth Is Fine\n03 - Miss Ella\n04 - Dearly Beloved\n05 - Change Parners\n06 - Sciatica Stomp\n07 - Funny\n08 - Prelude 'N Blues\n09 - I Got Rhythm\n10 - Simple Pleasures\n11 - Donna Lieb\n\nSplit with Medieval.\nEnjoy and share!
