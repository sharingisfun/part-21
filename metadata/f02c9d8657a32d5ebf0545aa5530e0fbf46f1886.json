Journalist Christopher Leonard spent more than a decade covering the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s biggest meat companies, including four years as the national agribusiness reporter for the Associated Press. Now he delivers the first comprehensive look inside the industrial meat system, exposing how a handful of companies executed an audacious corporate takeover of the nationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s meat supply.\n\nLeonardÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s revealing account shines a light on the inner workings of Tyson Foods, a pioneer of the industrial system that dominates the market. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn how the food industry got to where it is today, and how companies like Tyson have escaped the scrutiny they deserve. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll discover how these companies are able to raise meat prices for consumers while pushing down the price they pay to farmers. And youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll even see how big business and politics have derailed efforts to change the system, from a years-long legal fight in Iowa to the Obama administrationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s recent failed attempt to pass reforms.\n\nImportant, timely, and explosive, The Meat Racket is an unvarnished portrait of the food industry that now dominates AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s heartland.\n\nMeet the Author:\nChristopher Leonard is a Bernard L. Schwartz Fellow with The New America Foundation, a nonpartisan public policy institute in Washington, DC. He is the former national agribusiness reporter for the Associated Press and a graduate of the University of Missouri School of Journalism. He lives outside Washington, DC.\n\nGenre: Non-Fiction&gt; Agribusiness&gt; ExposÃƒÂ© ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f02c9d8657a32d5ebf0545aa5530e0fbf46f1886","amp;dn":"The+Meat+Racket_+The+Secret+Tak+-+Christopher+Leonard.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f02c9d8657a32d5ebf0545aa5530e0fbf46f1886","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,44,157,134,87,163,45,94,191,5,69,170,85,48,224,251,244,111,24,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
