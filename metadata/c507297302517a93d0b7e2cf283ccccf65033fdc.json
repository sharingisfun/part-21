Sharon's raw power, rhythmic swagger, moaning soulfulness, and melodic command set her firmly alongside Tina Turner, James Brown, Mavis Staples, and Aretha as a fixture in the canon of soul music. From the lush Philly-Soul fanfare that ushers in &quot;The Game Gets Old&quot; at the top of the record, to the stripped down Sam Cooke-style &quot;Mama Don't Like My Man&quot; at the tail, the Dap-Kings dance seamlessly through both the most crafted and simple arrangements with subtlety and discipline. I LEARNED THE HARD WAY is the &quot;Daptone Sound&quot; at its finest.\n\n\nTracklisting:\n1. The Game Gets Old\n2. I Learned The Hard Way\n3. Better Things\n4. Give It Back\n5. Money\n6.
