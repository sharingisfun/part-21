Kodikian freely admitted that he had stabbed Coughlin twice in the heart. Had there been a darker motive than mercy? And how could anyone, under any circumstances, kill his best friend?\n\nArmed with the journal Kodikian and Coughlin carried into Rattle- snake Canyon, Jason Kersten re-creates in riveting detail those fateful days that led to the killing in an infamously unforgiving wilderness.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b260a7c05f0932475d4937bfd5249c0e23599eb1","amp;dn":"Journal+of+the+Dead-+A+Story+of+Friendship+and+Murder+in+the+New","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b260a7c05f0932475d4937bfd5249c0e23599eb1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,96,167,192,95,9,50,71,93,73,55,191,213,36,156,14,35,89,158,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
