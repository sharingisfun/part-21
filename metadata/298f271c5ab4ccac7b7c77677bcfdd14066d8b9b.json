Miriam (Maya Dagan) is an adoring fan of Svika Pick (who appears as himself). She dreams of being a famous singer, leading her to mysteriously abandon her son Meir (Ido Rosenberg) on his tenth birthday. Both Meir and his best school friend Shuli-who happens to be a beautiful girl-have their eye on the same gorgeous guy. But despite worthy distractions, Meir never stops searching for his mother, eventually moving to Tel Aviv and becoming famous as a drag queen named Mary Lou. The songs never stop coming as Meir/Mary Lou discovers he needs to find himself even more than his mother.\n\n\nEnglish hard-coded sub.\n\n\n02:30:39\n640x352\n25 FPS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:298f271c5ab4ccac7b7c77677bcfdd14066d8b9b","amp;dn":"2009+Tamid+Oto+Chalom+%5BMary+Lou%5D+%28ISR%29+%5BEngHSub%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"298f271c5ab4ccac7b7c77677bcfdd14066d8b9b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,143,39,28,90,180,204,172,123,124,119,103,123,207,221,20,6,109,139,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
