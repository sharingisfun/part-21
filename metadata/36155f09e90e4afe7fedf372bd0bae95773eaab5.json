Rather than an unwieldy dump of thousands of issues that are meticulously numbered and ordered (and whose filenames screw with modern comic reader parsers), the Chronology is presented as a series of ad-hoc collections with a simple volume ordering. I'll be releasing these in series of 10 volumes a piece.\r\n\r\nAs with previous releases of this chronology, strict chronology order has been followed as close as possible, though some flexibility and &quot;grain of salt&quot; needs to be used for proper interpretation. Books have been culled from a variety of sources and all credit goes to the original scanners/rippers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36155f09e90e4afe7fedf372bd0bae95773eaab5","amp;dn":"Superman+Post-Crisis+Chronology%2C+Volumes+241-250","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36155f09e90e4afe7fedf372bd0bae95773eaab5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,21,95,9,233,14,74,254,127,237,243,114,189,11,174,149,119,62,170,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
