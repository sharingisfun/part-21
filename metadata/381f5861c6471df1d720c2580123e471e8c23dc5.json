Adding to the project's star status were Rilo Kiley's Jenny Lewis and former Tattle Tale member Jen Wood, both of whom contributed backing vocals to the band's mix of bubbling electronica and indie pop. Tamborello and Gibbard first worked together in 2001, when Gibbard provided vocals for the title track of Dntel's This Is the Dream of Evan and Chan EP. From there, the duo continued to collaborate via mail, with Tamborello sending instrumental tracks and Gibbard adding guitars, vocals, and lyrics. The results were packaged into the group's only album, Give Up, which was released in 2003 by Sub Pop. The disc had sold over 500,000 copies by 2005, prompting the band's co-founders to begin work on a second album. Work stalled as both musicians founds themselves devoting more time to their main projects, however, and the Postal Service remained on indefinite hiatus for the rest of the decade.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:381f5861c6471df1d720c2580123e471e8c23dc5","amp;dn":"The+Postal+Service+-+Give+Up+%5B24+bit+FLAC%5D+vinyl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"381f5861c6471df1d720c2580123e471e8c23dc5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,31,88,97,198,71,29,241,215,32,194,88,1,35,228,113,232,194,61,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
