Israel was the first; Libya and Iraq followed suit. Pakistan now almost nearing edge of a failed state possesses a substantial number of nuclear weapons which is posing serious danger to Iran, Russia, Kazakhstan, India and Nepal. The implications of the political and security dynamics of the Middle East for the United States and other nations are truly profound and sobering.\n \nBeyond Sand and Oil provides a nation-by-nation overview of the evolution of nuclear weapons programs in what is likely the world's most politically unstable region. A detailed assessment of Iran's prospects for becoming a nuclear weapons stateÃ¢â‚¬â€and how Israel, the Arab world, and the international community will respond to that outcomeÃ¢â‚¬â€is also included.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:851e6062b7d7e9a03a63ac5573cd15aa1d914ab8","amp;dn":"Beyond+Sand+and+Oil+The+Nuclear+Middle+East.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"851e6062b7d7e9a03a63ac5573cd15aa1d914ab8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,30,96,98,183,215,233,160,58,99,172,85,115,205,21,170,29,145,74,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
