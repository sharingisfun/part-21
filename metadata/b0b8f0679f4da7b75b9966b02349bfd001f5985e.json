It should all be in perfect order now. No greatest hits albums, because... All the songs are there, there's no need for them. The only Live albums I kept were: Best of Japan, Live at Carnegie Hall, and XXVI Live In Concert, because I don't see the point in having 10, almost identical, live performances of every song.\n\nThe albums included are the full versions of:\n\nChicago Transit Authority (Chicago I)\nChicago (Chicago II)\nChicago III\nChicago IV - Carnegie Hall\nChicago V\nChicago VI\nChicago VII\nChicago VIII\nChicago IX - Best of Japan\nChicago X\nChicago XI\nHot Streets (Chicago XII)\nChicago XIII\nChicago XIV\nChicago XVI\nChicago XVII\nChicago XVIII\nChicago XIX\nChicago XXI\nNight &amp; Day, Big Day Band (Chicago XXII)\nChicago XXIV - Live In Concert\nChicago XXV - Chicago Christmas - What's It Gonna Be, Santa?\nChicago XXIX - Love Songs {Okay, so I left in this one compilation album}\nChicago XXX\nChicago XXXII - Stone of Sisyphus\n\nLike I said, this is for people who would rather listen to the same, may I add, amazing, music, without having to scan through tons of duplicates, greatest hits albums, and bootleg live compilations. \n\n\n(it won't let me link the original page, so just go to torrentz[.]com and search &quot;Chicago Discography&quot;, and it should be the first one.)\n\nThat is where I got the original songs, but as you can see, that one is 3.6 GB, whereas mine is 1.7, as mine has not a single duplicate, or bonus track (which is usually just a demo version of a song you already have). If you wish to download the other one, for whatever reason, feel free; I am only offering a more organized, less spaced out, smaller(!) version of what whomever made the one in the link has already uploaded.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0b8f0679f4da7b75b9966b02349bfd001f5985e","amp;dn":"The+Real+Chicago+Discography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0b8f0679f4da7b75b9966b02349bfd001f5985e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,184,240,103,159,77,167,183,91,153,102,176,35,73,191,208,1,245,152,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
