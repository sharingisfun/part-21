But the army lieutenant she favors doesn't really appreciate her finer qualities. One of Jane's boasts brings her to Chicago to recruit an actress for the Golden Garter stage. Arrived, the lady in question appears (at first) to be a more feminine rival for the favors of Jane's male friends...including her friendly enemy Wild Bill Hickock.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa91e4af7fe3d12eddb1ff3b4b20fd842b261952","amp;dn":"Calamity+Jane+++%28Western+Comedy+1953%29+++Doris+Day%2C+Howard+Keel+%26","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa91e4af7fe3d12eddb1ff3b4b20fd842b261952","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,145,228,175,127,227,209,46,221,177,255,59,75,32,253,132,43,38,25,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
