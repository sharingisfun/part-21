Loren Schoenberg wrote all the liner notes and probably selected the music to be released as well.\n\nThey were originally released on the MUSIC MASTERS label. They have also been reissued by NIMBUS. This torrent has some of both. It contains three double CDs from NIMBUS (which sound great), a double CD and a 5 CD box set both from MUSIC MASTERS.\n\nThe NIMBUS releases are YALE UNIVERSITY ARCHIVES VOL. 1, 2 &amp; 5. They correspond to the original MUSIC MASTERS volumes 1-2, 3-4 &amp; 11-12.\n\nThe MUSIC MASTERS box KING OF SWING contains volumes 6-10 and the YALE UNIVERSITY MUSIC LIBRARY VOL. 5 is the only volume in the collection that was originally issued as a double CD.\n\nI include the above information so as to avoid unnecessary confusion.\n\nI am not going to type out all the session info, but I will give you a quick run down on the contents of the 12 volumes as originally issued (by Music Masters)...\n\nVol. 1 - various lineups (1955-67)\nVol. 2 - live at Basin Street (1955 septet)\nVol. 3 - from the European tour (1958)\nVol. 4 - big band recordings (1957-62)\nVol. 5 - from BG's private collection (1959-63) (2 CD)\nVol. 6 - live at The Rainbow Grill (1966-67 septet)\nVol. 7 - Florida sessions (1959 septet)\nVol. 8 - from BG's private collection (1957-61)\nVol. 9 - live at Basin Street (1954 sextet)\nVol. 10 - the original BG quartet (1963)\nVol. 11 - NBC broadcast recordings (1940-41)\nVol. 12 - NBC broadcast  recordings (1943, 1961, 1986, 1936)\n\nScans are included.
