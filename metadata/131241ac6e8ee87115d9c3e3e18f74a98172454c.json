A blacksmith named Balian has lost his family and nearly his faith. The religious wars raging in the far-off Holy Land seem remote to him, yet he is pulled into that immense drama. Amid the pageantry and intrigues of medieval Jerusalem he falls in love, grows into a leader, and ultimately uses all his courage and skill to defend the city against staggering odds. Destiny comes seeking Balian in the form of a great knight, Godfrey of Ibelin, a Crusader briefly home to France from fighting in the East. Revealing himself as Balian's father, Godfrey shows him the true meaning of knighthood and takes him on a journey across continents to the fabled Holy City.\n\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0320661&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0320661&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:131241ac6e8ee87115d9c3e3e18f74a98172454c","amp;dn":"The+Kingdom+of+Heaven+%282005%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"131241ac6e8ee87115d9c3e3e18f74a98172454c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,18,65,172,110,142,232,113,21,217,195,227,225,143,116,169,129,114,69,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
