Bazan (pronounced &quot;buh-zahn&quot;) was the lead singer and creative force behind the now-defunct band Pedro the Lion and was the lead singer of Headphones, a band he formed out of his interest in synthesizers. In early 2006, he began performing and recording under his own name.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bazan&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bazan&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFewer Moving Parts is David Bazan's debut EP, released in limited quantities on June 13, 2006. It was re-released on 22 May 2007 on Barsuk Records.\n\nThe EP was considered a stopgap release to tide fans over until his full-length solo debut. While officially an EP, Fewer Moving Parts is longer ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ in total tracks or in runtime ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ than some albums.\n\nThe EP features five songs in two forms: first with full instrumentation, then stripped-down acoustic. In its first incarnation, &quot;Backwoods Nation&quot; was a Pedro the Lion b-side, featured on the 2002 Jade Tree compilation Location is Everything, Volume 1. &quot;Cold Beer and Cigarettes&quot;, originally known by its alternate title, &quot;The Devil is Beating His Wife&quot;, came to light as a 2005 Pedro the Lion demo recording. It was originally slated to be on their now abandoned fifth full-length album, but was re-recorded for Fewer Moving Parts.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fewer_Moving_Parts&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fewer_Moving_Parts&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.
