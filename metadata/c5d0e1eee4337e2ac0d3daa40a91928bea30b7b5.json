These advances provide science with a wide range of tools for biomedical applications in therapeutic, diagnostic, and preventive medicine.\r\nNanotechnology in Biology and Medicine: Methods, Devices, and Applications integrates interdisciplinary research and recent advances in instrumentation and methods for applying nanotechnology to various areas in biology and medicine. Pioneers in the field describe the design and use of nanobiosensors with various analytical techniques for the detection and monitoring of specific biomolecules, including cancer cells. The text focuses on the design of novel bio-inspired materials, particularly for tissue engineering applications. Each chapter provides introductory material including a description of methods, protocols, instrumentation, and applications, as well as a collection of published data with an extensive list of references.\r\n\r\nAn authoritative reference written for a broad audience, Nanotechnology in Biology and Medicine: Methods, Devices, and Applications provides a comprehensive forum that integrates interdisciplinary research to present the most recent advances in protocols, methods, instrumentation, and applications of nanotechnology in biology and medicine","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c5d0e1eee4337e2ac0d3daa40a91928bea30b7b5","amp;dn":"Nanotechnology+in+Biology+and+Medicine+-+Tuan+Vo-Dinh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c5d0e1eee4337e2ac0d3daa40a91928bea30b7b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,208,225,238,228,51,126,42,192,211,218,164,10,145,146,139,234,48,183,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
