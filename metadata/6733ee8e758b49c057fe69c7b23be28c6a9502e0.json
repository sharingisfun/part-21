Armed only with  \n                    a mobile library she is determined to bring  \n                    knowledge to the people and rekindle her  \n                    romance despite the best attempts at sabotage  \n                    by Patty, her despotic mother. Libby's romantic  \n                    delusion is only punctured when she witnesses  \n                    the 'real' Frank, leaving her Elizabeth Bennett  \n                    without the Mr Darcy she craved. Overwhelmed by  \n                    his desire, Frank strains every sinew to win  \n                    her back using an unfamiliar weapon, honesty.  \n                    Jamie focuses all his energies into giving his  \n                    Madam, Michelle, whatever she wants in order to  \n                    pay off Karen's debts. But his unusual   \n                    behaviour rattles Karen and raises Paddy's  \n                    suspicions, and when Michelle makes it clear  \n                    she wants more than Jamie can give, the  \n                    pressure mounts. Risking the fury of a woman  \n                    scorned, but with everything he cares for at  \n                    stake, Jamie has no choice but to find a way  \n                    out.                                     \n                                                         \n                                                                                                \n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                          RiPPERS NOTES:                           \n                                                                      \n\n                     \n                        Enjoy this great release from BiA\n\n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                           GROUP NOTES:                            \n                                                                      \n\n                                   Greetz to \n\n                            FoV SFM TBS XiSO SAiNTS\n\n                            love your work boys ;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6733ee8e758b49c057fe69c7b23be28c6a9502e0","amp;dn":"Shameless.S07E07.HDTV.XviD-BiA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6733ee8e758b49c057fe69c7b23be28c6a9502e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,51,238,142,117,139,73,192,87,254,105,199,178,59,226,140,106,149,2,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
