Studios in Ibiza, Spain, from the early 1990s until May 2009, where he has recorded all of Enigma's studio releases to date. Cretu is both the composer and the producer of the project. His former wife, pop singer Sandra, often provided vocals on Enigma tracks. Jens Gad co-arranged and played guitar on three of the Enigma albums. Peter Cornelius also contributed to Enigma during the 1990s.\n\nI\tReturn To Innocence\t4:30\nII\tPrinciples Of Lust\t12:37\nIIa\tSadeness\t\nIIb\tFind Love\t\nIIc\tSadeness (Reprise)\t\nIII\tBeyond The Invisible\t5:13\nIV\tBack To The Rivers Of Belief\t8:23\nIVa\tHallelujah\t\nIVb\tThe Rivers Of Belief\nV\tAge Of Loneliness ( Carly s Song )\nVI\tWhy!\t5:23\nVII\tMea Culpa\t5:31\nVIII\tOut From The Deep\t5:17\nIX\tT.N.T.
