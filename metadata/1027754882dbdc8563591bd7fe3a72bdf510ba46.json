It's been gripping. But most of all it's been completely hilarious. 21 years after first appearing on our screens, audiences (which have reached 24 million) are still devoted to the antics of Del and Rodney and their muckers. But what is it about this Peckham posse that makes their marketplace wheelings and dealings so endearing to generations?\n\nWho would know better than the show's writer and the cast..? For the first time ever John Sullivan, David Jason, Nicholas Lyndhurst and the real faces behind Boycie, Trigger, Raquel, Cassandra and the gang reveal the secrets behind the success of this huge comedy hit.\n\nOn location at 127 Nelson Mandela House and at the Nag's Head, we discover the behind-the-scenes stories, the stars reveal their own favourite memories and we learn just how they went about making us love Britain's biggest plonkers.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1027754882dbdc8563591bd7fe3a72bdf510ba46","amp;dn":"Only-Fools-And-Horses+Special%5Bthe+story+of+O.F.A.H+aac+mp4+by+wi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1027754882dbdc8563591bd7fe3a72bdf510ba46","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,39,117,72,130,219,220,133,99,89,27,215,254,58,114,189,245,16,186,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
