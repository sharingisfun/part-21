Most books contain practical information though some are of a more theoretical (computer science) nature.\n\n95% of these books are no more than 3-4 years old. Some books date as far back as 1992. These books are included because nothing better has been written since then on that particular subject.\n\nI delete most certification books as these age too fast. The same is true of most books about specific software packages.\n\nTo find out if this is worth downloading, only download the /html directory first. and check out if the titles are anything for you.\n\nThe original file names have not been retained, as no common naming convention exist, and I need to access these files on several operating systems. The only way to use these files is through the html catalogue, or to go in and rename the files.\n\nSome directories have been zipped to limit the size of the torrent file - everyt\nhing name [publishing house].ZIP should be unzipped before attempting to use the\n those particular books.\n\nBooks are sorted by publishing House:\nAddison Wesley : 173 titles\nApress         :  17 titles\nArctech        :  17 titles\nCRC            :  13 titles\nDigital        :  11 titles\nHungry Minds   :  21 titles\nIBM            :  27 titles\nIdea Group     :  15 titles\nJones and Bartlett: 11 titles\nManning        :  28 titles\nMcGraw-Hill    :  68 titles\nMicrosoft      :  45 titles\nMiscelaneous   : 124 titles\nMIT            :  17 titles\nMorgan Kaufmann:  13 titles\nNew Riders     :  27 titles\nNo Starch Press:  15 titles\nOracle Press   :  18 titles\nO\\&amp;#039;Reilly       : 359 titles\nO\\&amp;#039;Reilly Bookshelves:\n  Java Reference Library v1.3\n  Java Enterprice cd bookshelf v1\n  Linux Web Server CD Bookshelf v1\n  Networking CD Bookshelf v1\n  Networking CD Bookshelf v2\n  Oracle PL/SQL CD Bookshelf v1\n  Perl CD Bookshelf v1\n  Perl CD Bookshelf v2\n  Perl CD Bookshelf v3\n  Perl CD Bookshelf v4\n  Unix CD Bookshelf v3\n  Web Design CD Bookshelf v1\n  Web Developers Library v1\n  Web Programming CD Bookshelf v1\n  XML CD Bookshelf v1\nPremier Press  :  19 titles\nPrentice Hall  :  93 titles\nPrima          :  16 titles\nQue            :  26 titles\nRampant        :  13 titles\nQuick Reference:  52 titles\nSams           : 100 titles\nSun Microsystem:  15 titles\nSybes          :  35 titles\nSyngress       :  31 titles\nWiley          : 156 titles\nWordware       :  22 titles\nWrox           :  29 titles\n\nC Users Journal 1990 - 2000\n\nI know the size if pretty obscene, but I trust you to take what you want from this, and not whine about the stuff that you don\\&amp;#039;t need or want.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e42b005fdcbae9436c9feb68f62be163547e5e98","amp;dn":"IT+professional%5C%27s+Library","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e42b005fdcbae9436c9feb68f62be163547e5e98","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,43,0,95,220,186,233,67,108,159,235,104,246,43,225,99,84,126,94,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
