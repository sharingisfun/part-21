Bortz\n\nRequirements: ePUB reader, 3.3 MB\n\nOverview: What's the average human life span...72 years...78 years? Actually, science has determined that humans were designed to live 120 years, and that, until now, most people died too soon. It's also now clear that most of the maladies we commonly associate with aging, such as frailty, senility, and arthritis aren't part of nature's plan, but the result of other factors such as bad nutrition, disease, and disuse. Best of all is the news that, no matter how old you are or what shape you're in, you can take steps to reverse the aging process that has already occurred in you and to slow your rate of aging in the future. You're never too old-or too young-to begin living a longer, healthier life, and &quot;Living Longer For Dummies&quot; can show you how. Written by a leading national expert on aging, it's packed with life-changing tips on nutrition, exercise, attitude and behavior, that can help enhance and sustain your physical and psychological well- being to age 100 and beyond","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd1b10c602cb3e2d378c9fa91d9fdb836f327df3","amp;dn":"Living+Longer+For+Dummies","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd1b10c602cb3e2d378c9fa91d9fdb836f327df3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,27,16,198,2,203,62,45,55,140,159,169,29,159,219,131,111,50,125,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
