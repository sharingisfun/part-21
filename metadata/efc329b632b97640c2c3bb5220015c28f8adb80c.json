Both NAT/PMP (Apple Airport base stations) and UPnP (D-Link, Linksys, Netgear) protocols are supported.\n\nPort forwardings are frequently necessary for tools such as instant messengers, file-sharing utilities and other networked applications that are run from behind a NAT gateway (read: a home network router). Being able to dynamically manage your port forwardings saves you from all the hassles of having to deal with cumbersome static forwardings.\n\tÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tStart and stop port forwardings with a single click\n\tÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tLives in your menu bar - always easily accessible\n\tÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tAutomatically start port forwardings when applications are launched\n\tÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tAutomatically start Lighthouse when you log into MacOS X\n\tÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tSupports NAT/PMP routers (such as Apple Airport base stations)\n\tÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tSupports UPnP routers (such as D-Link, Linksys or Netgear branded routers)\n\tÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tSupport for Growl notifications\n\tÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tComes with pre-made port mapping profiles for popular applications","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:efc329b632b97640c2c3bb5220015c28f8adb80c","amp;dn":"Lighthouse+v1.2.5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"efc329b632b97640c2c3bb5220015c28f8adb80c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,195,41,182,50,185,118,64,194,195,187,82,32,1,92,40,248,173,184,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
