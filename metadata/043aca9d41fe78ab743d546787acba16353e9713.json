This look allows you to see what is behind the border. The key element is the blurring of content behind the glass borders to prevent it from being too clear and disturbing. The result is very smart window border! \t\nFully native\nThe utility is completely integrated into Desktop Window Manager without breaking any system protection or modifying system files. All rendering is done via native Direct3D device. Any colorization settings adjusted in Windows Control Panels are respected. Use color intensity slider to adjust the amount of the transparency.\n\nNo custom skinning engine used. Due to the native nature of this utility your Windows theme is composited together with the glass effect. All features controlled through DWM API (e.g. DwmEnableBlurBehindWindow or DwmExtendFrameIntoClientArea) are supported including the taskbar or custom Start menu blur effect. \t\n\t\nLow resources usage!\nThis library tries to utilize all DWM resources as much as possible to minimize RAM and VRAM usage. No redudant objects are created, no background service is running. The result is light-weight library which behaves exactly in the same way as Aero Glass in Windows 7 did. No performance degradation!\nTheme your windows!\nYou can change the look of your windows borders completely without touching your Windows theme or using unsigned theme. This allows you to bring back several effects such as window shadow, caption glow effect, rounded borders or simply change the appearence of caption buttons. You just modify single bitmap in your favourite image editor and everything will look as you want! \t\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is an archive of glasspwn-1.1b. The software was originally uploaded onto deviantart by PwnMaster2014. Unfortunately, deviantart is not a very safe place to upload whatever cracks you may have made.\n\nHis download page is now offline and his account banned. Thanks for your work, pwnmaster. Sorry you got banned!\n\n\nInstructions:\n- Install Glass Aero 8.1\n- If you are going to use custom themes untick the shiny atlas during installation.\n- After you are done, run GlassPwn.\n- Hit next and let it work it's black voodoo magic, and your watermark will be gone!\n\nThere appears to be an issue with GlassPwn when rebooting sometimes. If the watermark returns after a reboot, simply run GlassPwn again.\n\nThanks guys and gals, and happy torrenting!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:043aca9d41fe78ab743d546787acba16353e9713","amp;dn":"glasspwn-1.1b%3A+Aero+Glass+for+8.1+and+Watermark+Remover","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"043aca9d41fe78ab743d546787acba16353e9713","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,58,202,157,65,254,120,171,116,61,84,103,135,172,186,22,53,62,151,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
