The only person there is a peculiar man whose job is to switch the trains. He doesn&amp;#039;t understand her language and won&amp;#039;t speak to her at all, so she quietly waits for another train, but there isn&amp;#039;t one. Eventually the winter weather forces her to shelter in his room. She unpacks her things and a wordless relationship begins to form.
