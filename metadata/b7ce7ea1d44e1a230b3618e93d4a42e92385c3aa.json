This album is a result of a session for 'Period Records' that was originally issued on two ten-inch records entitled 'Jazzical Moods'. The experimental workings of Mingus are briliantly explained in the booklet notes by the man himself in this suitably renamed format.\n\n\n Originally released on two 10&quot; records called Jazzical Moods, The Jazz Experiments of Charles Mingus makes its first appearance in CD. These 1954 Period Records sessions include the work of Thad Jones on trumpet and John LaPorta on clarinet and alto sax, combine old and new forms of classical and jazz for a cool jazz sound. Tracks like &quot;Minor Intrusion&quot; and &quot;Thrice Upon a Time&quot; demonstrate the synergy between Mingus and his players, and display his compositional skills.
