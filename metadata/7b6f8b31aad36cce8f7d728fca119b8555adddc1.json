Use Me (Bill Withers cover, produced by the Butcher Bros.)\n\nBrombergÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s first album came out in 1971 and featured a song written with and guest-starring George Harrison on slide, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Holdup.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Such a collaboration so early in oneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s career speaks volumes about the caliber of this multi-instrumentalist, singer and songwriter.\n\nIn the half-decade before that debut album, Bromberg played on LPs by the likes of Jerry Jeff Walker, Al Kooper and Bob Dylan. As his solo career progressed, he continued to lend his talents to artists as varied as Sha Na Na, Carly Simon, John Prine, Gordon Lightfoot, Rick Derringer, Willie Nelson, Doug Sahm, Ringo Starr, Phoebe Snow, Commander Cody and The Eagles.\n\nIn 1980, burned out from constant touring, he dissolved the David Bromberg Band. He stopped playing guitar and immersed himself in violin making, eventually opening a sales and repair shop in Wilmington, Del., where he lives to this day. With the exception of 1990ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â²s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSideman Serenade,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ he didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t record again until the 2007 Grammy-nominated solo acoustic disc ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTry Me One More Time.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œUse Me,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ his second release for Appleseed, features a different backup band on nearly every track, recorded in New York, Tennessee, Louisiana, Virginia, California, Colorado and Pennsylvania ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ all because of John Hiatt.\n\nAccording to the liner notes, after a concert in Wilmington, Hiatt invited Bromberg to his Nashville studio to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œmess around.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Bromberg accepted, hoping that once there, Hiatt might give him an original song to record in his studio. ThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s when he got the idea to contact friends, acquaintances and colleagues to see if they would not only write him a song, but also produce him doing their song.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI was very pleased that almost every person that I asked agreed to write (or if not a writer, to choose) a song and produce me performing it. Thus, USE ME,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ he writes in the liners.\n\ncd ripped by X Lossless Decoder\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/04/29/david-bromberg/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/04/29/david-bromberg/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b6f8b31aad36cce8f7d728fca119b8555adddc1","amp;dn":"David+Bromberg+-+Use+Me+%282011%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b6f8b31aad36cce8f7d728fca119b8555adddc1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,111,139,49,170,211,108,206,143,125,114,143,202,17,155,133,85,173,221,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
