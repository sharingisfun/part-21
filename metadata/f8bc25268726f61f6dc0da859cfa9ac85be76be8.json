The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo  \nMikael Blomkvist, a once-respected financial journalist, watches his professional life rapidly crumble around him. Prospects appear bleak until an unexpected (and unsettling) offer to resurrect his name is extended by an old-school titan of Swedish industry. The catch--and there's always a catch--is that Blomkvist must first spend a year researching a mysterious disappearance that has remained unsolved for nearly four decades. With few other options, he accepts and enlists the help of investigator Lisbeth Salander, a misunderstood genius with a cache of authority issues. Little is as it seems in Larsson's novel, but there is at least one constant: you really don't want to mess with the girl with the dragon tattoo.\n\n2. The Girl Who Played with Fire  \nMikael Blomkvist, crusading publisher of the magazine Millennium, has decided to run a story that will expose an extensive sex trafficking operation. On the eve of its publication, the two reporters responsible for the article are murdered, and the fingerprints found on the murder weapon belong to his friend, the troubled genius hacker Lisbeth Salander. Blomkvist, convinced of SalanderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s innocence, plunges into an investigation. Meanwhile, Salander herself is drawn into a murderous game of cat and mouse, which forces her to face her dark past.\n\n3. The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest \nIn the concluding volume of Stieg LarssonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Millennium trilogy, Lisbeth Salander lies in critical condition in a Swedish hospital, a bullet in her head.\n \nBut sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fighting for her life in more ways than one: if and when she recovers, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll stand trial for three murders. With the help of Mikael Blomkvist, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll need to identify those in authority who have allowed the vulnerable, like herself, to suffer abuse and violence. And, on her own, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll seek revengeÃ¢â‚¬â€against the man who tried to kill her and against the corrupt government institutions that nearly destroyed her life. \n\nSeed and Enjoy!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8bc25268726f61f6dc0da859cfa9ac85be76be8","amp;dn":"The+Girl+with+a+Dragon+Tattoo+Trilogy+by+Stieg+Larsson","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f8bc25268726f61f6dc0da859cfa9ac85be76be8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,188,37,38,135,38,246,31,109,192,218,133,156,250,154,200,91,231,107,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
