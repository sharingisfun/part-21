He is an attorney in Chicago who served as the House Prosecutor who tried and impeached Governor Rod Blagojevich before the Illinois Senate.\n\nJason Kolarich series:\n\nThe Hidden Man (#1): Jason Kolarich is a Chicago attorney with a lineman's build, a razor- sharp intellect-and the grief of a tragic personal loss. When an estranged childhood friend is charged with murder, Kolarich must create a solid defense-even while doubting his client's innocence. But it soon becomes clear that Kolarich will have to uncover long-forgotten events from their shared childhoods to save his friend-and bring a relentless killer to justice before he strikes again.\n\nBreach of Trust (#2): On the night his wife and infant daughter died, attorney Jason Kolarich was awaiting a call from an informant. He blames himself not only for the deaths of his family, but for the informant's murder as well. Kolarich can't bring back his family, but he can find the person who killed the informant. And he discovers that his informant's murder was only the tip of the iceberg-and that exposing the truth will drag him into the fight of his life.\n\nThe Wrong Man (#3): A young paralegal is brutally killed. A homeless Iraq war veteran has been caught with the murder weapon and the victimÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s belongingsÃ¢â‚¬â€and he canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t remember what happenedÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ \n\nJason Kolarich has been asked by the young manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s aunt to defend him. It seems like a standard insanity defense based on Post-Traumatic Stress DisorderÃ¢â‚¬â€until Kolarich realizes that his client is actually innocent. The victim had been working a case of her own, following a trail of paper and money that connected international terrorists to corporate America, where there are those who want to teach the U.S. government a lesson. \n\nKolarich knows finding the true murderer is the key to exposing the conspiracy. As time grows short for both his client and thousands of innocent Americans, he races to find a trained killer and uncover the details of the attack. But Kolarich soon discovers that the game has already been riggedÃ¢â‚¬â€and that he himself is about to become the next targetÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nFull Retail. ePub and Calibre reader ready.
