The evolution in Waters' classic sound began by using members of Waters' touring band: pianist Pine Top Perkins, bassist Bob Margolin, and drummer Willie &quot;Big Eyes&quot; Smith.\nWinter would subsequently bring the underrated Chicago blues guitarist (and long-time Waters' accompanist) Jimmy Rogers and extraordinary harp player Big Walter Horton to the sessions, and the resulting recording was pure magic.\n\n\n1.
