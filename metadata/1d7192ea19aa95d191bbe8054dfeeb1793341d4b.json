From someone prone to reviewing high-energy stuff, though, this is a nice change of pace.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Let the rain fall,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ he says. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Tomorrow is gonna be better,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ he says. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Time passes slow,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ he says. Ã¢â‚¬Å“IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll save it for another day,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ he says.\n\nMakes you want to charge out the door and conquer the world, huh?\n\nIf not, thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s okay. Because we all have those days where sleeping sounds better than anything else, or maybe stuff just sucks. DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t fear, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a Radin for that. Underwater is really a step back towards material from the earlier Radin catalog Ã¢â‚¬â€ see Ã¢â‚¬Å“One of Those DaysÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ from 2008Ã¢â‚¬Â²s Simple Times Ã¢â‚¬â€ but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s still perfect folkish melancholia ÃƒÂ  la Ryan Adams.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d7192ea19aa95d191bbe8054dfeeb1793341d4b","amp;dn":"Joshua+Radin+-+Underwater+%282012%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d7192ea19aa95d191bbe8054dfeeb1793341d4b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,113,146,234,25,170,149,209,145,187,232,5,77,254,235,23,147,52,29,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
