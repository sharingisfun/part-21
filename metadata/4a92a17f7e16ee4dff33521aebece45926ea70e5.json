Later on that year, the band moved to Los Angeles and signed a recording contract with MCA Records after a well-received showcase. \nThe band's self-titled debut album, released in 1988, peaked at No. 141 on the Billboard 200 the following year. \nMTV gave heavy airplay to the videos for &quot;Waiting for the Big One&quot; and &quot;Falling in and out of Love&quot;, the band's two signature songs. \nThe airplay helped the album to sell nearly 225,000 copies, but Femme Fatale was unable to match the popularity of other bands in the glam metal scene. \nThe band saw their status at MCA shrink and the band's manager, Andrea Accardo, developed a rare brain cancer. \nShortly after touring the world in support of Cheap Trick, recording was to commence on a new studio album, but ultimately it was never completed and the band dissolved in 1990. \n\n\nYear:\t1988\n\nStyle:\tHard Rock\n\nCountry:\tUSA\nFormat:\t320 mp3\n\nSize:\t90.68 MB\n\n\t\nAdded:\t24/08/2015 19:11:08\nFiles:\t10\n\nDescription:\t\n\n\nLength:\n00:39:24\n\nTracks :\n01.
