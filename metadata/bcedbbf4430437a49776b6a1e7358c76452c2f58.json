Captain Callum Israel, a man who has dedicated his life to the ocean, now must ask himself-as our planet dies-what it means to be an environmentalist after the world's ended. Callum and his crew will come up against pirates, rebels, murderers, and thieves as they struggle to remain noble toward their cause. Can you save a planet that's already doomed?\n\nThanks goes to theProletariat and SEGoat for this release.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bcedbbf4430437a49776b6a1e7358c76452c2f58","amp;dn":"The+Massive+1-10+%282013%29+%28theProletariat-SEGoat-Novus%29+%5BNVS-D%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bcedbbf4430437a49776b6a1e7358c76452c2f58","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,237,187,244,67,4,55,164,151,118,182,161,231,53,140,118,69,44,47,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
