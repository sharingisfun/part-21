Dragon Door published the best-selling Convict Conditioning books, and is considered an industry leader in fitness certifications. They have teamed with Paul Wade and Al Kavadlo to develop the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first body weight strength training certification Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the Progressive Calisthenics Certification. The workshops are evolved from a synthesis of the Convict Conditioning Ã¢â‚¬Å“old schoolÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ methods and Al KavadloÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“new schoolÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ methods. The 3 instructors are the Kavadlo brothers and Adrienne Harvey, who will be leading students through 11 different modules. This is not intended simply for advanced athletes Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the program is based on core principles which anyone, from beginner to advanced, can use to tailor their own workouts.
