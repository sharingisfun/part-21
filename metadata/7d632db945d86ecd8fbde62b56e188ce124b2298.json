A  2 hour version was offered for sale by a scumbag seller, who then pulled the auctions and disappeared. But i've managed to track down this version, which is almost *5 hours* in length...\n\nThese are NOT sourced from the same footage that was used on the 'Appendage' extras section of the Closure dvd leak, but from an alternate camera angle, shot by a completely different individual who also filmed on set. PAL format, expertly converted to a convenient 3 disc set by Itsjustdave. You can read more information about the background of these tapes in a dedicated thread in the NIN forum over at ETS:\n\n(http://www.echoingthesound.org/phpbbx/index.php)\n\nI'd like to dedicate the release of these dvds to everyone who contributed to the &quot;Blud Fund&quot;, organized by the very awesome Naut and Ryan at ETS/nin.au, which helped myself and my family through a very bad patch of financial difficulty and poor health. I hope this helps to say thanks and provides a nice little payback for all of your extraordinary generosity in my time of need. I hope you enjoy them, and again, words can't say how overwhelmed myself and my family were by your help. Thanks again everyone.\n\nMega thanks too to Dave (Itsjustdave), Nympholept and Matt (Leviathant) for all helping in one way or another to get these out to everyone. Their assistance was invaluable.\n\nShould you see any person, EVER trying to profit from these dvds on Ebay or anywhere else, please contact me at &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;cda8acb9b4a2b8bfafa1b8a9ff8daaa0aca4a1e3aea2a0&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; IMMEDIATELY and i'll take care of it. No money should EVER change hands for these discs...They are a gift to the community.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d632db945d86ecd8fbde62b56e188ce124b2298","amp;dn":"NIN+-+THE+UNRELEASED+BEHIND+THE+SCENES+OF+CLOSER+TAPES","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d632db945d86ecd8fbde62b56e188ce124b2298","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,99,45,185,69,216,110,205,143,189,230,43,86,225,136,206,18,75,34,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
