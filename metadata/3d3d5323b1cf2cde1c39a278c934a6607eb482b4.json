Simple sentences, repeated and rhyming words, audio guidance and picture clues ensure reading success. Children will explore a handy dictionary as they reference words and pictures found in the stories. Plus, Create-a-Story lets children discover creative writing and art as they write and illustrate their own stories. Each storybook is included for off-screen reading.\n \t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d3d5323b1cf2cde1c39a278c934a6607eb482b4","amp;dn":"On+Track+Beginning+Reading+Homeschool+Educational+Software+Learn","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d3d5323b1cf2cde1c39a278c934a6607eb482b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,61,83,35,177,207,44,222,28,57,162,120,201,52,166,96,126,180,130,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
