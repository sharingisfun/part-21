Signe Toly Anderson was the female vocalist and Skip Spence played drums. Both left the group shortly after the album's release and were replaced by Grace Slick and Spencer Dryden, respectively.\n        &quot;Lather&quot; is a song by Jefferson Airplane. It is the opening track on the 1968 album &quot;Crown of Creation&quot; and was the B-Side for the single of the same name.The band performed the song in their 1968 appearance on The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour. It is seen as a music video for the song as it features psychedelic effects.\n        &quot;Mona&quot; is Bo Diddley's eighth Checker Records single sometimes known as &quot;I Need You Baby&quot;) The song &quot;Mona&quot; was covered by many artists such as The Rolling Stones for their debut album in 1964 and by Quicksilver Messenger Service released on their second album Happy Trails in 1969. &quot;Mona&quot; was also recorded by soap opera star Craig McLachlan (as Craig McLachlan &amp; Check 1-2), reaching #2 in the United Kingdom and #3 in Australia in 1990. It was also recorded by Buddy Holly in 1957, though it was never released.\n        &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; is the national anthem of the United States of America. The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; was recognized for official use by the Navy in 1889, and by President Woodrow Wilson in 1916, and was made the national anthem by a congressional resolution on March 3, 1931, which was signed by President Herbert Hoover.      \n       &quot;Kozmic Blues&quot; is a song from Janis Joplin's I Got Dem Ol' Kozmic Blues Again Mama! album, her first after departing the Big Brother and the Holding Company. It was a part of Joplin's set at Woodstock Festival in 1969. Although the concert as a whole is not regarded as Joplin at her best, that specific performance became very popular and was released on &quot;The Essential Janis Joplin&quot;.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9bccccb48d34f02ca3bac2921f36fef9dd4b9da6","amp;dn":"HISTORY+OF+POP+AND+ROCK+MUSIC+-+part+392","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9bccccb48d34f02ca3bac2921f36fef9dd4b9da6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,204,204,180,141,52,240,44,163,186,194,146,31,54,254,249,221,75,157,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
