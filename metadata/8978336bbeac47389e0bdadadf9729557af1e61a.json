Harbinson&amp;#039;s amazing SF novel Projekt Saucer Book 2 - Phoenix (1995) which continues the epic story of the American-Nazi secret flying saucer project into the years after World War II, uncovering in the process a nightmare web of secret scientific experimentation and the collusion of the super-power governments with the horrific organization responsible. The core idea of Projekt Saucer (spanning 5 books in total) revolves around an Earth-based source for flying saucers or UFOs. Rather than blaming them on aliens, the flying saucers are created by an awesome conspiracy, created by a doctor named Wilson (as people used to nickname first UFOs that appeared throughout USA). Through the first book (Inception), Wilson takes his ideas to Nazi Germany - incidentally creating the Foo Fighters along the way - and then into a colony in the frozen continent - Antarctica. In the years that follow, WilsonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s flying saucers give rise to the entire UFO phenomenon - apart from much more primitive saucers flown by the US and the USSR - including alien abductions, UFO bases, UFO theories, UFO encounters, UFO dangers. Harbinson started to uncover the nightmarish truth about UFOs in the research for his international bestseller Genesis (now book 3 of this series). The basic thrust was that UFOs did not come from an extraterrestrial source, but were in fact man-made, originating right here on Earth. He felt that with the addition of further research the material could be the basis for an epic novel about the whole flying saucer phenomenon. The author ties in every known UFO rumour, attributing it to Wilson or to one of the American saucers. Quite apart from Roswell, or any of a dozen other encounters that were widely reported at the time, the books include political dirty-dealing between the world powers on one hand and WilsonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s colony on the other. There have always been rumours that elements in the global powers have made deals with aliens - Harbinson has them trading with people who make Himmler&amp;co look like amateurs. It also includes investigations into UFOs by researchers, discouraged, threatened - all of which eventually end badly. If you can imagine H.G. Wells&amp;#039; War of the World combined with Jules Verne&amp;#039;s captain Nemo-like personalities and super-duper technology then you simply can&amp;#039;t afford to miss this mindblowing series. The Projekt Saucer series has become a cult favourite through the years although no movie was ever made about it. If you have ever seen movies like X-Files, War of the worlds and others this book series easily dwarfs them all as facts and fiction blend together to create an unique and above all - nightmarish world of the future. 365 pages. A must read for everyone.
