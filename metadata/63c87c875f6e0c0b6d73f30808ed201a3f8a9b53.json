From dolls to doll blankets, scarves to backpacks, the 20 projects in this fun, colorfully illustrated collection are especially geared to kids. The easy-to-follow lessons proceed logically from very basic to more advanced skills, so youngsters can keep on learning as they work. TheyÃ‚â€™ll see how to read patterns; cast on and do simple stitches; bind off; darn in the ends; make tassels, fringes, and pom-poms; sew on a snap fastener; join a new ball of yarn, and more. It wonÃ‚â€™t be long before the youngest knitters are completing a headband, cat toy, teddy bear puppet, and drawstring purse.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:63c87c875f6e0c0b6d73f30808ed201a3f8a9b53","amp;dn":"Kids+Knit%21+by+Sarah+Bradberry","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"63c87c875f6e0c0b6d73f30808ed201a3f8a9b53","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,200,124,135,95,110,12,11,109,115,243,8,8,237,32,26,63,138,155,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
