Running a bar I do this every month trying to find something nice (and new) for the customers. I usually end up with three lists.\n\n1. Nice, clear and easy for people who like to talk while listening.\n2. A bit louder for people who are not able to talk anymore (too crowded).\n3. The ones I like myself and donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t fit in one of the above categories.\n\nOnly the best (sounding) tracks are selected. They are in 100% clean and fully labelled MP3 VBR format. This might save you some time.\n\nEnjoy and keep the Indie spirit high (by promoting, sharing and seeding).\n\n\nDutch Treat - Indie Playlists 1203\n\n28 - @1 The Way In\n\n01 - Working Titles (Damien Jurado)\n02 - Feather On The Clyde (Passenger)\n03 - Forces (Like Spinning)\n04 - Suitcase (Emeli SandÃ¢â‚¬Å¡)\n05 - Down In The Valley (The Head &amp; The Heart)\n06 - Go To Me (Jordan Klassen)\n07 - Danse Carribe (Andrew Bird)\n08 - Good People (The Gertrudes)\n09 - Feel To Follow (The Maccabees)\n10 - Good Intent (Kimbra)\n11 - More Things To Say (Boyce Avenue)\n12 - Night All Night (Diagrams)\n13 - September (The Shins)\n14 - Ageless (House Of Wolves)\n15 - Thoughts (George Barnett)\n16 - Wild Wind (Shannon Rose &amp; The Thorns)\n17 - Headcage (Matthew Dear)\n18 - To A Poet (First Aid Kit)\n19 - As I Sat Sadly By Her Side (Nick Cave &amp; The Bad Seeds)\n20 - The Way In (Porcelain Raft)\n\n\n29 - @2 Want Go\n\n01 - Want Go (Dante)\n02 - I Got You Babe (Bahamas)\n03 - Main Street (Deer Tick)\n04 - Tonight (Boyce Avenue)\n05 - So Much Time (Boyce Avenue)\n06 - Rocket Ship (San Cisco)\n07 - Tapes &amp; Money (Totally Enormous Extinct Dinosaurs)\n08 - Locking Seth Putnam In A Hot Topic (Rob Crow (Of Pinback))\n09 - April Fool (Manchester Orchestra)\n10 - Stairway (Yukon Blonde)\n11 - Milwaukee (Bright Moments)\n12 - Anglepoise Cymbals (Selector Dub Narcotic)\n13 - Almost A Year (Moss)\n14 - Fifteen Feet Of Pure White Snow (Nick Cave &amp; The Bad Seeds)\n15 - Teary Eyes And Bloody Lips (Moonface)\n16 - Geri (Superhumanoids)\n17 - 1919 (We Are Animal)\n18 - Whistleblower (Arkells)\n19 - Don't You Touch Me (Soko)\n20 - D.D.
