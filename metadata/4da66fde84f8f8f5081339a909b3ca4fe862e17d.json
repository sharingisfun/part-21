John Robison was never a model child, and he wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t a model dad either. Diagnosed with AspergerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s syndrome at the age of forty, he approached fatherhood as a series of logic puzzles and practical jokes. When his son, Cubby, asked, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Where did I come from?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ John said heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d bought him at the Kid Store and that the salesman had cheated him by promising Cubby would Ã¢â‚¬Å“do all chores.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ He read electrical engineering manuals to Cubby at bedtime. He told Cubby that wizards turned children into stone when they misbehaved.\n\nStill, John got the basics right. He made sure Cubby never drank diesel fuel at the automobile repair shop he owns. And he gave him a life of adventure: By the time Cubby was ten, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d steered a Coast Guard cutter, driven a freight locomotive, and run an antique Rolls Royce into a fence.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4da66fde84f8f8f5081339a909b3ca4fe862e17d","amp;dn":"Raising+Cubby%3A+A+Father+and+Son%27s+Adventures+with+Asperger%27s","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4da66fde84f8f8f5081339a909b3ca4fe862e17d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,166,111,222,132,248,248,245,8,19,57,169,9,179,202,79,232,98,225,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
