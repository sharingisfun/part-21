Targeted by the media, sentenced by the courts, and wrongfully imprisoned for four excruciating years for a crime neither could fathom let alone perpetrate, Raffaele Sollecito and Amanda Knox were the victims in a trial so bizarre it defied all reason. Now, for the first time since his acquittal, Raffaele reveals what really happened between him and his then girlfriend before, during, and after AmandaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s roommate Meredith KercherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s brutal murder. \n\nFilled with family drama, wild reversals of fortune, and a blow-by-blow account of the legal catastrophe as it unfolded, this harrowing firsthand account sheds fascinating new light on one of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most controversial murder cases. With startling candor, Raffaele shares intimate details about his changing relationship with AmandaÃ¢â‚¬â€one that veered in a matter of days from giddy romance to grueling police interrogations. Over the next four years, Raffaele was the only solid alibi Amanda had for the night of the murder. He came under unrelenting pressureÃ¢â‚¬â€from his own family and lawyers as much as the police and prosecutionÃ¢â‚¬â€to change his testimony and stop vouching for her. But he wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t do it. He refused to testify against her to save his own skin, because he knew she would be lost forever. \n\nRaffaele sifts through the wild accusations depicting him as a druggie, a porn addict, and reckless thrill seeker, and shows how these stories were gross distortions of trivial episodes in his young life. With unflinching honesty, he takes readers behind the scenes of the trial of the centuryÃ¢â‚¬â€and inside the day-to-day hell of prison life. Finally, and poignantly, Raffaele talks about his first face-to-face reunion with Amanda following their release. \n\nEmotional, disturbing, and ultimately galvanizing, this memoir is more than a true-crime storyÃ¢â‚¬â€it is a riveting account of an egregious miscarriage of justice, of public condemnation, and personal survival. Honor Bound is also, at its heart, a tragic love story about a young man who trusted his feelings, refused to give up hope, and ultimately triumphed.\n\n\n:Greetz:\nTo All Silver RG Encoders, All SilverTorrentHD Encoders &amp; All Other P2P RGs\n\n:Note:\nMake sure its real Silver RG Release From Silver RG Member\n\nWe Are Looking For Early Access To Anything You Can Provide CAMS, TS, DVD Screeners, VHS Screeners, DVDRips, Direct Audio, Early Music Release, Anything You Can Provide Seedboxes, Accounts, Dedicated Servers \n\n:Support:\nTakes 10 Seconds to say&quot;Thank You&quot;, or 4 seconds to say &quot;Whoooo&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d87a1f7aade2a95d672dac320493782bd7af534","amp;dn":"Honor+Bound_+Amanda+Knox+%28ePub%2C+Mobi%29+-+sum1_here","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d87a1f7aade2a95d672dac320493782bd7af534","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,135,161,247,170,222,42,149,214,114,218,195,32,73,55,130,189,122,245,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
