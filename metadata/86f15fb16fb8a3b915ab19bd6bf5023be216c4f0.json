Although unaware of the full potential of this new weapon, he knows that it is capable of doing tremendously more damage than any other weapon used before, and that the death toll resulting from it will be enormous. He is reluctant to be the person who will end so many lives, but if using it may bring an end to the war, then not doing so may result in even more lives being lost in continued ground assaults as the fighting goes on. At the same time, the intense secrecy surrounding this mission leaves him with no one he can express his thoughts and doubts to, not even his wife. As time goes on, the pressure upon him only increase.\n \nSinopse Pt Br:\n\nUm filme que retrata a preparaÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o para o lanÃƒÂ§amento da bomba atÃƒÂ´mica sobre Hiroshima, o drama, os segredos, tendo no comando Paul Tibbets (Robert Taylor) e com Jim Backus no papel do general Curtis E.
