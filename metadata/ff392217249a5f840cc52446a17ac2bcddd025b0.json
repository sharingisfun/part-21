Howard, Benjamin S. Cazzolato (CRC, 2015).pdf\n\nISBN 978-1-4822-2327-9\n\nTechniques and Tools for Solving Acoustics Problems\n\nThis is the first book of its kind that describes the use of ANSYSÃ‚Â® finite element analysis (FEA) software, and MATLABÃ‚Â® engineering programming software to solve acoustic problems. It covers simple text book problems, such as determining the natural frequencies of a duct, to progressively more complex problems that can only be solved using FEA software, such as acoustic absorption and fluid-structure-interaction. It also presents benchmark cases that can be used as starting points for analysis. There are practical hints too for using ANSYS software. The material describes how to solve numerous problems theoretically, and how to obtain solutions from the theory using MATLAB engineering software, as well as analyzing the same problem using ANSYS Workbench and ANSYS Mechanical APDL.\n\nDeveloped for the Practicing Engineer\n\nFree downloads on http://www.mecheng.adelaide.edu.au/avc/software, including MATLAB source code, ANSYS APDL models, and ANSYS Workbench models\nIncludes readersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ techniques and tips for new and experienced users of ANSYS software\nIdentifies bugs and deficiencies to help practitioners avoid making mistakes\nAcoustic Analyses Using MATLABÃ‚Â® and ANSYSÃ‚Â® can be used as a textbook for graduate students in acoustics, vibration, and related areas in engineering; undergraduates in mechanical and electrical engineering; and as an authoritative reference for industry professionals","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff392217249a5f840cc52446a17ac2bcddd025b0","amp;dn":"Acoustic+Analyses+Using+Matlab%26reg%3B+and+Ansys%26reg%3B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff392217249a5f840cc52446a17ac2bcddd025b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,57,34,23,36,154,95,132,12,197,36,70,161,122,194,188,221,208,37,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
