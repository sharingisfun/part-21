His &quot;high-energy boogie-blues&quot; sound became a staple of 1980s rock radio, with hits like his original songs &quot;Bad to the Bone&quot; and &quot;I Drink Alone&quot;. He has also helped popularize older songs by American icons, such as &quot;Move It On Over,&quot; &quot;Who Do You Love?&quot; and &quot;House Rent Boogie/One Bourbon, One Scotch, One Beer&quot;, which became staples of classic rock radio.\n\nWith his band, the Delaware Destroyers, Thorogood has released over twenty albums, two of which that were certified Platinum, six that have been certified Gold, and have sold 15 million albums worldwide. Thorogood and band continue to tour extensively and in 2014 celebrated their 40th anniversary performing.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n30th Anniversary Tour: Live is the fourth live album by George Thorogood and the Destroyers.
