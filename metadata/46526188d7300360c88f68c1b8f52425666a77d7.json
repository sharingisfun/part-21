Besides stuff like Bowery Electric that you might have heard before on my other compilations, there are some ultra-rare stuff like Rekhmire, Bitstream Dream or Blue Tofu that hasn&amp;#039;t appeared yet on those other compilations. Not as biased towards trip-hop classics, Caferino Albuquerque Vol. 4 is varied enough to like to fans of more experimental trip-hop like R/R Coseboom or fans of instrumental hip-hop-ish stuff like Urchin or fans of Ninja Tune sonic explorations (see Rekhmire) and so on...\nEnjoy!\n\n\ntracklisting:\n1.
