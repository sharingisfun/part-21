Each text has its own introduction, and full indexes are provided. &quot;The Coptic Gnostic Library&quot; is the starting point for all research into ancient Gnosticism. It is the result of decades of dedicated research by the most distinguished international scholars in this field. &quot;The Coptic Gnostic Library&quot; is the only authoritative edition of many of the Coptic writings of the Gnostics from the first centuries AD. It was originally published by Brill in fourteen hardback volumes as part of the Nag Hammadi (and Manichaean) Studies series between 1975 and 1995, under the general editorship of James M. Robinson. Now, for the first time, it is available in paperback, at a fraction of the price of the original hardback editions. - Photomechanical paperback reprint of the original 14 hardback volumes - Complete and unabridged: 5 volumes, totaling approximately 5,000 pages - Facing Coptic texts and English translations, Introductions, Notes, and Indexes.\r\n\r\nPISTIS SOPHIA\r\nCoptic Text edited by Carl Schmidt; English translation by Violet MacDermot \r\nPublished by E.J. Brill, 1978. \r\nThis â€œgnosticâ€ text purportedly relates the â€œpost-resurrection teaching of Jesus,â€ â€œ[d]iscourse by Jesus on his garments of light,â€ Jesusâ€™ account â€œof his ascension wearing the garment of light; the rebellion of the aeons against the light, and the removal of power from those that rebelled.â€ It also contains discourses concerning the mysteries, i.e., rites, that enable the practitioner to escape the bonds of darkness. It provides a fascinating look into the world of primitive Christianity and thus provides insight into the views of early Christians on women, secular and sacerdotal power, knowledge and rival religious movements. \r\n\r\nTHE BOOKS OF JEU AND THE UNTITLED TEXT IN THE BRUCE CODEX\r\nCoptic Text edited by Carl Schmidt; English translation by Violet MacDermot \r\nPublished by E.J. Brill, 1978. \r\nThese texts are closely related to, and are perhaps mentioned in, the Pistis Sophia. Like that work, the Books of Jeu contain the teachings of Jesus to his disciples (men and women) about the creation of the world, its fall from glory, and the way back to light. Central to these texts are themes of secret teachings to be disclosed only to the worthy, and sacred rites, likewise withheld from the vulgar, that enable the soul to make its way back to the Pleroma. \r\n\r\nHigh and low resolution scans of Pistis Sophia and the Books of Jeu are included for the readerâ€™s convenience","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56e800f50559eb9ef66602f9bd33b2d8d8777a13","amp;dn":"Coptic+Gnostic+Library","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56e800f50559eb9ef66602f9bd33b2d8d8777a13","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,232,0,245,5,89,235,158,246,102,2,249,189,51,178,216,216,119,122,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
