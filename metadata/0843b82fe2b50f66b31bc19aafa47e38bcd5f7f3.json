Birdy goes undercover herself, posing as famous model Arita Shion that often uses a space girl look. A male student, Senkawa, stumbles upon a fight between the two one night in an abandoned building only to be severed in half as he is used as a shield by Geega against Birdy. Birdy heals him from imminent death in some fashion- but Senkawas body, and life, are now changed and permanently linked to Birdy.*\n                                                               *&quot;borrowed&quot; from ANN\nMore info can be found at...\nhttp://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=9287\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birdy_the_Mighty_Decode\nhttp://myanimelist.net/anime/3974/Tetsuwan_Birdy_Decode\n\nAnd the XviD batch can be found at AoShen's website under &quot;Complete&quot;.
