Very loosely adapted by Ben Hecht and Seton I. Miller from a novel by Rafael Sabatini, the film casts Power as rogueish, hot-tempered buccaneer Jamie Waring, who considers the day wasted when he hasn't sacked a Spanish galleon or plundered a rich coastal town. Jamie's partner in crime is pirate king Henry Morgan Laird Cregar, an alliance that comes to an end when Morgan is appointed governor of Jamaica. Disgusted by this defection, Jamie considers joining the scurrilous Redbeard George Sanders, but eventually decides to reform his ways when he falls in love with Margaret Denby Maureen O'Hara, the gorgeous daughter of the former Jamaican governor Lord Denby George Zucco. Before the final obligatory sail into the sunset, however, Margaret is kidnapped and manhandled on a seemingly hourly basis, while Jamie is subjected to even more abuse at the hands of pirates and officials alike. Henry King handles the derring-do in Black Swan with commendable sobriety, leaving the story's tongue-in-cheek elements in the capable hands of the cast and the screenwriters.\n\nFile Name .........................................: The Black Swan.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 1,354,311,680 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 1:24:24\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size ......................................: 648x472 (AR: 1.373)\nFPS .................................................: 23.976\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1938 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.264 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 192 kb/s [2 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0034522/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0034522/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEnglish audio; English, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles\n\nMy rip\n\nHenry King - The Black Swan (1942)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:113262376c9c0d6551e2e69c86ab2a5f3a28a6a0","amp;dn":"Henry+King+-+The+Black+Swan+%281942%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"113262376c9c0d6551e2e69c86ab2a5f3a28a6a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,50,98,55,108,156,13,101,81,226,230,156,134,171,42,95,58,40,166,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
