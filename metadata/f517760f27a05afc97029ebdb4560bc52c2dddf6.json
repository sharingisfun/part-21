However, it took more out of him than he was prepared to give. He turned his back on the movie industry and decided to pursue a Ã¢â‚¬Ëœless emotionally taxingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ career. In an effort to escape from his inner demons, Peter purchased a storage facility in the heart of Los Angeles. All is going according to plan until Charlie (Sarah Jones), a down-on-her-luck actress, walks into his storage facility and changes everything.\n\nGenre: Drama\nIMDB Rating: 2.0/10 from 19 users\nDirected by: John Suits\nStarring: Tom Everett Scott, Sarah Jones and Josh Zuckerman\n\nRelease Name: 2nd.take.2011.VODRIP.XVID-HS\nSize: 854 MB\nVideo: AVI | 853Ãƒâ€”354 | 1 023 kbps\nAudio: English | MP3 | 128 kbps\nRuntime: 1h 42mn","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f517760f27a05afc97029ebdb4560bc52c2dddf6","amp;dn":"2nd.take.2011.VODRip.XviD-HS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f517760f27a05afc97029ebdb4560bc52c2dddf6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,23,118,15,39,160,90,252,151,2,158,189,180,86,11,197,44,45,221,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
