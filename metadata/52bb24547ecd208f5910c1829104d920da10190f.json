Like many other TV detectives, Ho was something of a maverick, often using unorthodox methods to solve crimes.\n\nHo's immediate superior in the police force was Det. Insp. Berwick (Derek Martin) and he was also often seen visiting his father Joe (Robert Lee) at his restaurant for advice.\n\nArthur Kelly as Detective Sergeant Donald Chegwin\nRobert Lee as Joe Ho\nDerek Martin as Detective Chief Inspector Berwick\nDavid Yip as Detective Sergeant Johnny Ho\n\nFormat Drama\nCreated by Ian Kennedy Martin\nStarring David Yip\nDerek Martin\nRobert Lee\nCountry of origin United Kingdom\nNo. of episodes 14\nProduction\nRunning time 1 Hour\nBroadcast\nOriginal channel BBC\nOriginal run 30 April 1981 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5 November 1982","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:52bb24547ecd208f5910c1829104d920da10190f","amp;dn":"THE+CHINESE+DETECTIVE+S1+and+S2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"52bb24547ecd208f5910c1829104d920da10190f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,187,36,84,126,205,32,143,89,16,193,130,145,4,217,32,218,16,25,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
