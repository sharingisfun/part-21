He is the older brother of Juicy J, co-founder of the Three 6 Mafia. \r\n\r\nProject Pat broke onto the mainstream scene after providing the hook for Three 6 Mafia's hit &quot;Sippin' on Some Sizzurp&quot; in 2000 and released his breakthrough album Mista Don't Play: Everythangs Workin', the most successful album ever for an independent artist on the Hypnotize Minds label, the next year. In 2001, he was arrested for parole violation after a pair of revolvers were discovered in his vehicle during a traffic stop. That March, he was sentenced to four years in prison on two counts of a felon in possession of a firearm. His third album Layin' Da Smack Down was released during Pat's incarceration. In late 2009, Project Pat began attempting to start up a new record label called D-Brady Ent.\r\n\r\n[b]Project Pat â€Žâ€“ Mista Don't Play Everythangs Workin[/b]\r\n[b]Genre:[/b] Hip Hop\r\n[b]Style:[/b] Gangsta\r\n[b]Year:[/b] 2000\r\n \nhttp://i.imgur.com/m2aIEij.png\r\n\r\nExact Audio Copy V1.1 from 23.
