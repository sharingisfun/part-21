Something has happened that has left the world barren and empty. Well, mostly empty. Some of the dead have come back and are wreaking havoc, having evolved and taken to hiding rather than the typical stumbling and moaning. The survivors are few and far between and since animals and vegetation are a thing of the past, they have taken to eating the flesh of the undead. While it may be a bearable temporary solution, we can only imagine that the long-term effects will be damaging.\r\n\r\nThe story is a little bit confusing at times, and as it is shot on video, the picture is a little shaky and the sound is not consistent, with some sections of dialogue a bit hard to hear. Outside of these minor technicalities, Blood Pigs is pretty awesome, straight up fun. It has an original premise that follows through with what it promises and then some, and for an indie, WOW, there are some crazy effects in here.\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo: XviD, 608x336, 29.970 fps, 953 Kbps, 01h24m24s\r\nAudio: Dolby AC3, 48000 Hz, stereo, 192 kbps\r\n\r\nDVDRip, English audio, no subtitles\r\n\r\n[the aspect ratio is a little squashed, use your player to expand the height]\r\n\r\ncover: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/jqf7n2udl/\r\n\r\nscreenshots: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/mgy51ivhr/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/ty7cgql0v/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/hh0otkpv3/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/6l9ay84xb/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5bc959b926ff2d63a5fbcdfe7471198bfd17ffa6","amp;dn":"Blood+Pigs+%282010%29+indie+post+apocalypse+zombie+gore+horror","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5bc959b926ff2d63a5fbcdfe7471198bfd17ffa6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,201,89,185,38,255,45,99,165,251,205,254,116,113,25,139,253,23,255,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
