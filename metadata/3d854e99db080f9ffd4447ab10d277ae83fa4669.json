The band consists of vocalist Dolores O'Riordan, guitarist Noel Hogan, bassist Mike Hogan and drummer Fergal Lawler. Although widely associated with alternative rock, the band's sound also incorporates indie pop, post-punk, Irish folk and pop rock elements.[1]\n\nThe Cranberries rose to international fame in the 1990s with their debut album, Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can't We?, which became a commercial success and sold over five million copies in the United States. The group was one of the most successful rock acts of the '90s and sold over 15 million albums in the United States alone. The band has achieved four top 20 albums on the Billboard 200 chart (Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can't We?; No Need to Argue; To the Faithful Departed and Bury the Hatchet)[2] and eight top 20 singles on the Modern Rock Tracks chart (&quot;Linger&quot;, &quot;Dreams&quot;, &quot;Zombie&quot;, &quot;Ode to My Family&quot;, &quot;Ridiculous Thoughts&quot;, &quot;Salvation&quot;, &quot;Free to Decide&quot; and &quot;Promises&quot;).[2]\n\nAfter a six-year hiatus, The Cranberries reunited and began a North American tour, followed by dates in Latin America and Europe in early 2010.[3][4] The band recorded their sixth album, Roses, in May 2011, and released it on 27 February 2012. \n\n\nEverybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can't We? 1993\n\nEverybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can't We? is the debut album by Irish rock band The Cranberries. Released in 1993, it was their first full-length album after having released four EPs, and is also their first major label release. The album was written entirely by the band's lead singer Dolores O'Riordan and guitarist Noel Hogan. It reached #9 in the Irish charts and #1 in the UK.\n\nThe album was re-released in 2002, under the title Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can't We? (The Complete Sessions 1991-1993). This version of the album featured bonus tracks as well as B-sides from the singles lifted off the album.\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;I Still Do&quot; \n2.\t&quot;Dreams&quot; \n3.\t&quot;Sunday&quot; \n4.\t&quot;Pretty&quot; \n5.\t&quot;Waltzing Back&quot; \n6.\t&quot;Not Sorry&quot; \n7.\t&quot;Linger&quot; \n8.\t&quot;Wanted&quot; \n9.\t&quot;Still Can't...&quot; \n10.\t&quot;I Will Always&quot; \n11.\t&quot;How&quot; \n12.\t&quot;Put Me Down&quot; \n13.\t&quot;Reason&quot; \n14.\t&quot;Them&quot; \n15.\t&quot;What You Were&quot; \n16.\t&quot;Liar&quot; \n17.\t&quot;Pretty&quot; (PrÃƒÂªt-ÃƒÂ -Porter Movie Remix)\n18.\t&quot;How&quot; (Radical Mix)\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d854e99db080f9ffd4447ab10d277ae83fa4669","amp;dn":"Cranberries+-+Everybody+Else..+%28Sessions+2002%29+%5BFLAC%5D+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d854e99db080f9ffd4447ab10d277ae83fa4669","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,133,78,153,219,8,15,159,253,68,71,171,16,210,119,174,131,250,70,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
