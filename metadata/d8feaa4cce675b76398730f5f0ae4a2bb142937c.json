The game's camera keeps an over-the-shoulder view from behind the playable character. The player may move the protagonist while aiming a weapon, and has the option to switch between a first-person and third-person perspective. A new device, the Genesis, detects items hidden throughout the game's environments. \n\nExtra features include Raid Mode, allowing two players to cooperate in battling waves of enemies. Players are also able to send in-game supplies to friends via the StreetPass feature of the Nintendo 3DS. The Wii U version offers additional features using the Wii U GamePad, including dual screen gameplay, Off-TV Play and Miiverse functionality. The game supports the Circle Pad Pro expansion peripheral. \n\nInstallation Information: \n========================= \n\n* Burn or mount \n* Install \n* Play the game \n\nNOTE: Say no, when asked if you want to send gameplay info to \nRESIDENT EVIL.NET \nNOTE: As usual, block the game exe in your firewall. \n\nMinimum System Requirements \nOS: Windows XP/Vista/7 \nProcessor: Intel Core 2 Duo @ 2.4 Ghz / AMD Athlon 64 X2 5600+ \nMemory: 2 Gb \nHard Drive: 8 Gb free \nVideo Memory: 512 Mb \nVideo Card: nVidia GeForce 8800 GTS / ATI Radeon HD 3850 \nSound Card: DirectX Compatible \nDirectX: 9.0c \nKeyboard \nMouse \nDVD Rom Drive \n\nRecommended System Requirements \nOS: Windows Vista/7 \nProcessor: Intel Core 2 Quad @ 2.66 GHz / AMD Phenom II X4 @ 3.0 GHz \nMemory: 4 Gb \nHard Drive: 8 Gb free \nVideo Memory: 1 Gb \nVideo Card: nVidia GeForce GTX 560 / ATI Radeon HD 6950 \nSound Card: DirectX Compatible \nDirectX: 9.0c \nKeyboard \nMouse \nDVD Rom Drive","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8feaa4cce675b76398730f5f0ae4a2bb142937c","amp;dn":"Resident_Evil_Revelations-FLT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8feaa4cce675b76398730f5f0ae4a2bb142937c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,254,170,76,206,103,91,118,57,135,48,245,240,174,74,43,177,66,147,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
