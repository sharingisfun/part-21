Your Future Depends on It.\nby Mitch Joel\n2013 | ISBN: 1455523305 | English | 288 Pages | EPUB | 0.40 MB \n \nThe DNA of business has changed. Forever. You can blame technology, smartphones, social media, online shopping and everything else, but nothingchanges this reality: we are in a moment of business purgatory. \n\nSo, what are you going to do about it? \n\nMitch Joel, one of the world's leading experts in new media, warns that the time has come to CTRL ALT DELETE. To reboot and to start re-building your business model. If you don't, Joel warns, not only will your company begin to slide backwards, but you may find yourself unemployable within five years. \n\nThat's a very strong warning, but in his new book, CTRL ALT DELETE, Joel explains the convergence of five key movements that have changed business forever. The movements have already taken place, but few businesses have acted on them. He outlines what you need to know to adapt right now. He also points to the seven triggers that will help you take advantage of these game-changing factors to keep you employable as this new world of business unfolds. \n\nAlong the way, Joel introduces his novel concept of &quot;squiggle&quot; which explains how you can learn to adapt your personal approach to your career, as new technology becomes the norm. \n\nIn short, this is not a book about &quot;change management&quot; but rather a book about &quot;changing both you AND your business model.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07b03387bf105bfed07afdf3e6ba7a005d51f372","amp;dn":"Ctrl+Alt+Delete+-+Reboot+Your+Business.+Reboot+Your+Life.+Your+F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07b03387bf105bfed07afdf3e6ba7a005d51f372","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,176,51,135,191,16,91,254,208,122,253,243,230,186,122,0,93,81,243,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
