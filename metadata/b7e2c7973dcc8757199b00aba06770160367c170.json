Taking place right after Shrek 2 ends, the plot was that characters from Shrek would sing and dance popular songs at the time, and at the end the viewer gets to pick the winner. However, if any character outside of Shrek, Donkey, Princess Fiona and Puss were selected, Cowell would refuse to accept the winner and proclaim himself the victor, leaping onto a table and performing his &quot;own&quot; rendition of &quot;My Way&quot;. This segment was also seen on the ABC airings of the film, between the post-credits scene and the closing credits after. The winner on this airing is Simon Cowell, since there was no way the viewer could interactively pick the winner.\n\n[b]Info:[/b]\n\n      General\n      \n      Format : Flash Video\n      File size : 45.0 MiB\n      Duration : 5mn 24s\n      Overall bit rate : 1 164 Kbps\n      \n      \n      Video\n      \n      Format : AVC\n      Format/Info : Advanced Video Codec\n      Format settings, CABAC : Yes\n      Format settings, ReFrames : 3 frames\n      Duration : 5mn 24s\n      Bit rate :  1 034 Kbps\n      Width : 854 pixels\n      Height : 478 pixels\n      Frame rate : 29.970 fps\n      \n\n      Audio\n      \n      Format : AAC\n      Format/Info : Advanced Audio Codec\n      Format profile : LC\n      Duration : 5mn 24s\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Channel positions : L R\n      Sampling rate : 44.1 KHz\n\n\n      IMDB\n\n     &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0438844/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0438844/&lt;/a&gt;\n      \n\n[b]Screenshots:[/b]\n\n[img]http://img263.imageshack.us/img263/4841/ss1eg.png[/img]\n[img]http://img405.imageshack.us/img405/5610/ss2b.png[/img]\n[img]http://img826.imageshack.us/img826/6945/ss3r.png[/img]\n\n\n................................................\nOPEN .NFO FILES WITH NOTEPAD\n................................................\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7e2c7973dcc8757199b00aba06770160367c170","amp;dn":"The+Shrek+Complete+Collection+%5BMovies+%2B+TV+Specials+%2B+Videos%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7e2c7973dcc8757199b00aba06770160367c170","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,226,199,151,61,204,135,87,25,155,0,171,160,103,112,22,3,103,193,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
