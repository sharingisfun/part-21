Born in the Virgin Islands, Griffith moved to New York where, before becoming a boxer, he designed ladies' hats. Once inside the ring his career took off and regular boxing telecasts made him a celebrity. In a 1962 match, Griffith beat Benny &quot;Kid&quot; Paret to death. Griffith's star faded and the incident ended boxing broadcasts.\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo: XviD, 592x336, 29.970 fps, 977 Kbps, 01h27m33s\r\nAudio: MP3, 48000 Hz, joint stereo, 128 kbps\r\n\r\nDVDRip, English audio, no subtitles\r\n\r\ncover: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/y1djdjpqv/\r\n\r\nscreenshots: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/8t4xmqavx/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/8ruztb925/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/sxyhs74pp/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/db78etqxp/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:850a8ca9e1783380ca401273a1be41a7a3bd29fe","amp;dn":"Ring+of+Fire%3A+The+Emile+Griffith+Story+%282005%29+boxing+documentary","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"850a8ca9e1783380ca401273a1be41a7a3bd29fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,10,140,169,225,120,51,128,202,64,18,115,161,190,65,167,163,189,41,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
