An exclusive 1959 performance recorded live in Indianapolis. Following the 2012 release of Resonance's archival set Echoes of Indiana Avenue, author, photo journalist, and private collector Duncan Schiedt approached the label to see if they'd be interested in releasing a live tape of Wes Montgomery he owned. It was a 1959 set where the guitarist sat in with the Eddie Higgins Trio, then featuring drummer Walter Perkins (and also an unknown bassist).\r\n\r\nResonance arranged for the rights and released One Night in Indy in 2016. Montgomery's star was just beginning to rise â€“ he recorded two sessions for Riverside in 1958 â€“ and Higgins established himself as an attraction on the Chicago circuit but, at this time, they were essentially operating on the same level of stardom and, appropriately enough, this date showcases them equally, with Montgomery's rich runs nicely accentuating the elegance of Higgins. If the audio is a little rough at times â€“ the set was recorded on a homemade recorder in 1959, after all â€“ the performances never are: even when the tempo starts cooking on &quot;Stompin' at the Savoy,&quot; this music rolls easy and the appeal is that mellow yet lively interplay, as each leader seems to want nothing more than to play off of the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTracklist:\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n01 - Give Me The Simple Life\r\n02 - Prelude To A Kiss\r\n03 - Stompin' At The Savoy\r\n04 - Li'l Darlin\r\n05 - Ruby My Dear\r\n06 - You'd Be So Nice To Come Home To\r\n\r\n*2016 Resonance Records / Rising Jazz Stars | HCD-2018\r\n\r\n\r\nPersonnel:\r\nWes Montgomery - guitar\r\nEddie Higgins - piano\r\nunknown bassist\r\nWalter Perkins - drums\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy and Sharing, Thanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMore Wes Montgomery Album's...\r\n\r\n\r\nWes Montgomery &amp; The Wynton Kelly Trio - The Unissued 1965 Half Note Broadcasts (2013) [EAC-FLAC]:\r\n  \nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8813304/Wes_Montgomery__amp__Wynton_Kelly_Trio_-_1965_Broadcasts_(2013)_\r\n\r\n\r\nWes Montgomery - Echoes Of Indiana Avenue (2012) [EAC-FLAC]:\r\n   \nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8809621/Wes_Montgomery_-_Echoes_Of_Indiana_Avenue_(2012)_[EAC-FLAC]\r\n\r\n\r\nWes Montgomery - The Montgomeryland Sessions [2CD] (2013) [EAC-FLAC]:\r\n \nhttps://thepiratebay.org/torrent/8816616/Wes_Montgomery_-_The_Montgomeryland_Sessions_(2013)_[EAC-FLAC]\r\n\r\n\r\nWes Montgomery - Full House (1962) [EAC-FLAC]:\r\n \nhttps://thepiratebay.org/torrent/12714632/Wes_Montgomery_-_Full_House_(1962)_[EAC-FLAC]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c528baa3bbc762d9e73166f4e95058bfacd1eb28","amp;dn":"Wes+Montgomery+%26amp%3B+The+Eddie+Higgins+Trio+-+One+Night+In+Indy+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c528baa3bbc762d9e73166f4e95058bfacd1eb28","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,40,186,163,187,199,98,217,231,49,102,244,233,80,88,191,172,209,235,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
