At the time of these recordings, the distorted amplified sound of James' slide guitar with his unmistakable electrified Robert Johnson lick was helping map out the postwar blues idiom with such classics as &quot;I Believe,&quot; &quot;Blues Before Sunrise,&quot; &quot;Wild About You,&quot; &quot;Mean &amp; Evil,&quot; and the extraordinary reworking of Robert Johnson's &quot;Dust My Broom&quot; into &quot;Dust My Blues.&quot; \nThis set is a great Introduction to the dynamic slide guitarist's earliest recordings.
