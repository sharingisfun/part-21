It was prepared as part of the project JELARE (Joint European-Latin American Universities Renewable Energy Project), undertaken as part of the ALFA III Programme of the European Commission involving countries in Latin America (e.g. Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Guatemala) as well as in Europe (Germany and Latvia). Thanks to its approach and structure, this book will prove useful to all those dedicated to the development of the renewable energy sector, especially those concerned with the problems posed by lack of expertise and lack of training in this field","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:62025bde316b5c87ba61d1ac8939d455555ad77f","amp;dn":"Educational+and+Technological+Approaches+to+Renewable+Energy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"62025bde316b5c87ba61d1ac8939d455555ad77f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,2,91,222,49,107,92,135,186,97,209,172,137,57,212,85,85,90,215,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
