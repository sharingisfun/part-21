This comprehensive resource is the most authoritative guide available to a sustainable lifestyle and living off of the land.\n\nCarla Emery started writing The Encyclopedia of Country Living in 1969 during the back-to-the-land movement of that time. She continued to add content and refine the information over the years, and the book went from a self-published mimeographed document to a book of 928 pages.\n\nThis 40th Anniversary Edition reflects the most up-to-date resource information and the most personal version of the book that became Carla Emery's life work. It is the original manual of basic country skills that have proved essential and necessary for people living in the country, the city, and everywhere in between.\n\nCarla Emery's The Encyclopedia of Country Living contains 1,000,000 words, 2,000+ recipes, and 1,500+ mail-order sources (for everything she tells you how to do, she also tells you where to get the supplies to do it). This book is so basic, so thorough, so reliable, that it deserves a place in every home.\n\n\nBy Carla Emery\nPublished by Sasquatch Books in 2012\nEPUB, Retail, 928 pages, English ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8e77c9785b268c5fb0552402880b7cf01dd67ba","amp;dn":"The+Encyclopedia+of+Country+Living%28ePUB%2CRetail%29%7B32Skulls%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8e77c9785b268c5fb0552402880b7cf01dd67ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,231,124,151,133,178,104,197,251,5,82,64,40,128,183,207,1,221,103,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
