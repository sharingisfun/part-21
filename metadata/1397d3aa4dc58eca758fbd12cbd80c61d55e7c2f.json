He started the internet advertising company ClickAgents from his bedroom at the age of 16, and sold it two years later for $40 million, turning his sibling employees into millionaires and saving his family's dream house. Facing family pressures and discrimination due to his Sikh background, Gurbaksh moved away from home and worked at the ValueClick for two years, becoming the youngest executive of the multi-billion dollar NASDAQ-listed company. Chahal then went on to found his second company, BlueLithium, which he sold in 2007 to Yahoo! for $300 million. Encouraging people to effectively harness risk and discipline for their own gain, Chahal shares his daring personal vision and his extraordinary experiences to reveal that success is much closer than most aspiring entrepreneurs realize.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1397d3aa4dc58eca758fbd12cbd80c61d55e7c2f","amp;dn":"The+Dream+-+How+I+Learned+the+Risks+and+Rewards+of+Entrepreneurs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1397d3aa4dc58eca758fbd12cbd80c61d55e7c2f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,151,211,170,77,197,142,202,117,143,189,18,203,216,12,97,213,94,124,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
