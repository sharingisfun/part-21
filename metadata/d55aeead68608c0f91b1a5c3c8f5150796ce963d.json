The combination of unwavering support for Israel and the related effort to spread ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“democracyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ throughout the region has inflamed Arab and Islamic opinion and jeopardised not only US security but that of much of the rest of the world. This situation has no equal in American political history. Why has the US been willing to set aside its own security and that of many of its allies in order to advance the interests of another state? One might assume that the bond between the two countries was based on shared strategic interests or compelling moral imperatives, but neither explanation can account for the remarkable level of material and diplomatic support that the US provides.\n\nInstead, the thrust of US policy in the region derives almost entirely from domestic politics, and especially the activities of the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Israel LobbyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢. Other special-interest groups have managed to skew foreign policy, but no lobby has managed to divert it as far from what the national interest would suggest, while simultaneously convincing Americans that US interests and those of the other country ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ in this case, Israel ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ are essentially identical.\n\nSince the October War in 1973, Washington has provided Israel with a level of support dwarfing that given to any other state. It has been the largest annual recipient of direct economic and military assistance since 1976, and is the largest recipient in total since World War Two, to the tune of well over $140 billion (in 2004 dollars). Israel receives about $3 billion in direct assistance each year, roughly one-fifth of the foreign aid budget, and worth about $500 a year for every Israeli. This largesse is especially striking since Israel is now a wealthy industrial state with a per capita income roughly equal to that of South Korea or Spain.\n\nOther recipients get their money in quarterly installments, but Israel receives its entire appropriation at the beginning of each fiscal year and can thus earn interest on it. Most recipients of aid given for military purposes are required to spend all of it in the US, but Israel is allowed to use roughly 25 per cent of its allocation to subsidise its own defence industry. It is the only recipient that does not have to account for how the aid is spent, which makes it virtually impossible to prevent the money from being used for purposes the US opposes, such as building settlements on the West Bank. Moreover, the US has provided Israel with nearly $3 billion to develop weapons systems, and given it access to such top-drawer weaponry as Blackhawk helicopters and F-16 jets. Finally, the US gives Israel access to intelligence it denies to its Nato allies and has turned a blind eye to IsraelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s acquisition of nuclear weapons.\n\nWashington also provides Israel with consistent diplomatic support. Since 1982, the US has vetoed 32 Security Council resolutions critical of Israel, more than the total number of vetoes cast by all the other Security Council members. It blocks the efforts of Arab states to put IsraelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s nuclear arsenal on the IAEAÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s agenda. The US comes to the rescue in wartime and takes IsraelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s side when negotiating peace. The Nixon administration protected it from the threat of Soviet intervention and resupplied it during the October War. Washington was deeply involved in the negotiations that ended that war, as well as in the lengthy ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“step-by-stepÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ process that followed, just as it played a key role in the negotiations that preceded and followed the 1993 Oslo Accords. In each case there was occasional friction between US and Israeli officials, but the US consistently supported the Israeli position. One American participant at Camp David in 2000 later said: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Far too often, we functioned ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ as IsraelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s lawyer.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Finally, the Bush administrationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ambition to transform the Middle East is at least partly aimed at improving IsraelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s strategic situation.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d55aeead68608c0f91b1a5c3c8f5150796ce963d","amp;dn":"The+Israel+Lobby","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d55aeead68608c0f91b1a5c3c8f5150796ce963d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,90,238,173,104,96,140,15,145,177,165,195,200,245,21,7,150,206,150,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
