Musa (CRC, 2015).pdf\r\n\r\nUnderstanding the physical properties and dynamical behavior of nanochannel flows has been of great interest in recent years and is important for the theoretical study of fluid dynamics and engineering applications in physics, chemistry, medicine, and electronics. The flows inside nanoscale pores are also important due to their highly beneficial drag and heat transfer properties.\r\n\r\nNanoscale Flow: Advances, Modeling, and Applications presents the latest research in the multidisciplinary area of nanoscale flow. Featuring contributions from top inventors in industry, academia, and government, this comprehensive book:\r\n\r\nHighlights the current status of research on nucleate pool boiling heat transfer, flow boiling heat transfer, and critical heat flux (CHF) phenomena of nanofluids\r\nDescribes two novel fractal models for pool boiling heat transfer of nanofluids, including subcooled pool boiling and nucleate pool boiling\r\nExplores thermal conductivity enhancement in nanofluids measured with a hot-wire calorimeter\r\nDiscusses two-phase laminar mixed convection AL2O3â€“water nanofluid in an elliptic duct\r\nExplains the principles of molecular and omics imaging and spectroscopy techniques for cancer detection\r\nAnalyzes fluid dynamics modeling of the tumor vasculature and drug transport\r\nStudies the properties of nanoscale particles and their impact on diagnosis, therapeutics, and theranostics\r\nProvides a brief background and review of medical nanoscale flow applications\r\nContains useful appendices of physical constants, equations, common symbols, mathematical formulas, the periodic table, and more\r\nA valuable reference for engineers, scientists, and biologists, Nanoscale Flow: Advances, Modeling, and Applications is also designed for researchers, universities, industrial institutions, and government, giving it broad appeal","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13e4996e8bd466ddd4ee4f583f8f5f7cd03aa9f2","amp;dn":"Nanoscale+Flow+-+Advances%2C+Modeling%2C+and+Applications","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13e4996e8bd466ddd4ee4f583f8f5f7cd03aa9f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,228,153,110,139,212,102,221,212,238,79,88,63,143,95,124,208,58,169,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
