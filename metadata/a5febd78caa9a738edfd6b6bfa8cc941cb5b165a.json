Her\nnewest album, &amp;#039;Robyn&amp;#039; is a collection of\nultra-concise pop moments  that rarest of things, a\nclassic pop album. It&amp;#039;s a sad-eyed, super-strong\nbattery of nuclear-powered pop and it&amp;#039;s the best\nweapon she&amp;#039;s got.\n\nThe UK release of &amp;#039;Robyn&amp;#039; also features re-recorded,\njumped up versions of &amp;#039;Bum Like You&amp;#039; and &amp;#039;Robotboy&amp;#039;.\nThe boisterous Cobrastyle (which was previously\nreleased on last years &amp;#039;Rakamonie EP&amp;#039;) and the heart\nachingly beautiful &amp;#039;With Every Heartbeat&amp;#039; has also\nbeen added.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5febd78caa9a738edfd6b6bfa8cc941cb5b165a","amp;dn":"Robyn-Robyn-%28UK_Retail%29-2007-uF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5febd78caa9a738edfd6b6bfa8cc941cb5b165a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,254,189,120,202,169,167,56,237,253,107,107,250,140,201,65,203,91,22,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
