Hyperion \nand The Fall Of Hyperion set a new standard for grand-scale science \nfiction.&quot; (Kevin J. Anderson, author of The Saga of Seven Suns)\n&quot;Dan Simmons was a star from the outset. It was the Hyperion books that \nmade him a superstar. The man, quite simply, is what we in the trade \ncall a writer's writer.&quot; (Mike Resnick, Hugo and Nebula Award-winning \nauthor)\nEach of [the pilgrim's] stories would make a superb novella on its own. \n(The New York Times Book Review, Gerald Jonas)\nPublisher's Summary\n\nOn the world called Hyperion, beyond the law of the Hegemony of Man, \nthere waits the creature called the Shrike. There are those who worship \nit. There are those who fear it. And there are those who have vowed \nto destroy it.\n\nIn the Valley of the Time Tombs, where huge, brooding structures move \nbackward through time, the Shrike waits for them all. On the eve of \nArmageddon, with the entire galaxy at war, seven pilgrims set forth \non a final voyage to Hyperion seeking the answers to the unsolved riddles \nof their lives. Each carries a desperate hope - and a terrible secret. \nAnd one may hold the fate of humanity in his hands.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:abc7d28919240c5960fbbdcdaac16d9f448ad66a","amp;dn":"Dan+Simmons+-+Hyperion","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"abc7d28919240c5960fbbdcdaac16d9f448ad66a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,199,210,137,25,36,12,89,96,251,189,205,170,193,109,159,68,138,214,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
