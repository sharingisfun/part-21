Well, here you can, as the\nfourth part of this recording is from the soundcheck, blessed\nbe me! (No, not me actually, because I wasn't the one standing\nabout with the Walkman unconspicuously hidden somewhere under\nhis T-shirt. But I might have been, so I graciously receive your\nblessings.)\n\nTechnically, what you get here is ripped as-is from two cassettes,\none of them a CrO2, the other a somewhat. Somewhere on its way to\nmy tapes the recording got clipped, and sometimes you can clearly\nhear what a worn-out tape sounds like. But that's live, isn't it?\nNo noise reduction or any other post processing have been applied\non my side, and you may want to adjust the balance a little, though\nthe difference between the two channels is hardly recognizable.\n\n\nTrack list:\n==========================================\nTape 1, Side A (43:39):\n------------------------------------------\n(Intro: Relax)\nShake Dog Shake\nPiggy in The Mirror\nPlay for Today\nA Strange Day\nPrimary\nThe Kyoto Song\nCharlotte Sometimes\nThe Blood\nIn Between Days\n\n==========================================\nTape 1, Side B (43:42):\n------------------------------------------\nThe Walk\nA Night Like This\nPush\nOne Hundred Years\nA Forest\nThe Sinking\nClose to Me\nLet's Go to Bed\n\n==========================================\nTape 2, Side A (29:04):\n------------------------------------------\nSix Different Ways\nThree Imaginary Boys\nBoys Don't Cry\nFaith\nWhy Can't I Be You?\n10:15 Saturday Night\nKilling an Arab\n\n==========================================\nTape 2, Side B (23:19):\n------------------------------------------\n(In Between Days)\nM\nWhy Can't I Be You?\nThe Figurehead\nSix Different Ways\n(Screw)\n(Piggy in The Mirror)\nShake Dog Shake\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:673f189a0991a4b87ab72efb0ab1c682a7b5bb8b","amp;dn":"The+Cure+-+Dax%2C+1986","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"673f189a0991a4b87ab72efb0ab1c682a7b5bb8b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,63,24,154,9,145,164,184,122,183,46,251,10,177,198,130,167,181,187,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
