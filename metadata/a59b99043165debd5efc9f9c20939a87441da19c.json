It introduced new readers to the work of Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko, and other Marvel creators, and packaged the material in a traditional book format that carried more cachÃƒÂ© than the flimsy pamphlet style of a typical comic book. Many of the books featured painted covers illustrated by such artists as Bob Larkin, John Romita, Sr., and Earl Norem. In this way, the series was an antecedent to the now common practice of packaging &quot;classic&quot; stories into archival editions and trade paperback collections including Marvel's 1998 book Grandson of Origins of Marvel Comics.\n\n------\n\nYou can also check out http://members.tripod.com/adams_fan/fireside.html for a ton of useful info on the whole series.\n\n------\n\nThis is a follow-up to my Origins of Marvel Comics torrent (and also requested by darthmung). Unfortunately I couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t find a scan of the original Fireside/Simon &amp; Schuster 1976 edition of BRING ON THE BAD GUYS, the third book after ORIGINS and SON OF ORIGINS. But I did have the 1998 reprinting ... and I have good news and bad news.\n\nThe good news is, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s still awesome and they expanded it with a two-part Dr. Doom story by John Byrne and Jerry Ordway. The bad news is that they didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t use the gorgeous (Simon &amp; Schuster copyrighted?) original painted John Romita Sr. cover! So I included that as a standalone JPEG in the torrent.\n\nAlso here is the 1998 sequel BRING BACK THE BAD GUYS.\n\nThe essays by Stan Lee are fascinating reads, and these collected editions feature great Marvel stories from Fantastic Four #5 (1962) to Super-Villain Classics: Galactus the Origin #1 (1983) to Iron Man #275 (1991). The books in this torrent run over 500 pages (about 250 to 260 pages each). All credit to the original scanners!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a59b99043165debd5efc9f9c20939a87441da19c","amp;dn":"BRING+ON+THE+BAD+GUYS+%282+trade+paperbacks%29+Marvel+1976-1998","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a59b99043165debd5efc9f9c20939a87441da19c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,155,153,4,49,101,222,189,94,252,159,156,32,147,154,135,68,29,161,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
