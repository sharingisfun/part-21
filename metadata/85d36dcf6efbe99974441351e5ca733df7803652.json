Highlighted by the 20-minute version of Ellington's &quot;In a Mellow Tone&quot; in which tenor titans Ben Webster, Coleman Hawkins, and Budd Johnson plus trumpeter Roy Eldridge stretch out, not so much in a cutting contest as a laid-back jam session amongst friends. This summit meeting turned out to be a tribute to another tenor master of the same generation, Lester Young, who had died less than four weeks before this session. The chosen rhythm section of Jimmy Jones on piano, Les Spann on guitar, Ray Brown on bass, and Jo Jones on drums equally matches the performance of the featured horns. Also tackled for this session were three Webster originals: &quot;De-Dar,&quot; &quot;Young Bean,&quot; and &quot;Budd Johnson&quot; and the standard &quot;Time After Time.&quot; Unfortunately no bonus tracks are included (if they even exist) but the excellent sound restoration more than makes up for it.
