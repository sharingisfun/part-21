Clarifying the knowledge acquired in this field has become all the more urgent for any care-giver today confronted by a legitimate request from patients: Why and how can a surgical procedure, which is supposed to bring relief, leave behind an unacceptable sequela?\n\nThis is the approach which the contributors to this new subject of major clinical interest invite you to follow as you work your way through this book.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:15555f305a5da29c44bb86948000889dfd13711b","amp;dn":"Chronic+Postsurgical+Pain+%28Springer%29+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"15555f305a5da29c44bb86948000889dfd13711b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,85,95,48,90,93,162,156,68,187,134,148,128,0,136,157,253,19,113,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
