In addition, the book targets an interdisciplinary community, and in particular the Multimedia and the Semantic Web communities. Finally, the authors provide both the fundamental knowledge and the latest state-of-the-art results from both communities with the goal of making the knowledge of one community available to the other.\n\nKey Features:\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Presents state-of-the art research results in multimedia semantics: multimedia analysis, metadata standards and multimedia knowledge representation, semantic interaction with multimedia\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Contains real industrial problems exemplified by user case scenarios\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Offers an insight into various standardisation bodies including W3C, IPTC and ISO MPEG\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Contains contributions from academic and industrial communities from Europe, USA and Asia\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Includes an accompanying website containing user cases, datasets, and software mentioned in the book, as well as links to the K-Space NoE and the SMaRT society web sites\n\nThis book will be a valuable reference for academic and industry researchers /practitioners in multimedia, computational intelligence and computer science fields. Graduate students, project leaders, and consultants will also find this book of interest.\n\n\nPLZ SEED AFTER DOWNLOADING..\n\n&quot;LIVE AND LET LIVE&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:afeb1575a534f4ae0254f199373ae557ae63b201","amp;dn":"Multimedia+Semantics+-+Metadata%2C+Analysis+and+Interaction%5BTeam+N","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"afeb1575a534f4ae0254f199373ae557ae63b201","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,235,21,117,165,52,244,174,2,84,241,153,55,58,229,87,174,99,178,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
