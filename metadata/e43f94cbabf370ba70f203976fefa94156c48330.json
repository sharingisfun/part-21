Leaving all preconceptions of the banjo-wielding songstress behind, WhitworthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new adventure steers into waters both familiar and refreshingly new, Gibson SG in hand.\n\nOn the heels of a year spent touring with Chris Isaak and the Tedeschi-Trucks Band and recording as the singing voice of Belk department storesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ latest campaign, High Tide finds Whitworth collaborating with Bill Reynolds (Band of Horses) and producer Seth Kauffman, while continuing to hit the road with her core quartet.\n\nFrom the first rolling rhythms, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s evident that this album charts new waters. Just as her music stems from Appalachian roots (sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a favorite at MerleFest) but sheds its traditional skin at the door, High Tide begins with a journey to the coast that takes rest stops in reverb-drenched jazz and indie rock along the way, setting the mood for a tight but playful expedition. Whether youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re holed up in a chilly Appalachian barn or walking the coast on a hot August evening, WhitworthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s High Tide holds universal appeal, from the mountains to the sea.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e43f94cbabf370ba70f203976fefa94156c48330","amp;dn":"Shannon+Whitworth+-+High+Tide+%5B2013%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e43f94cbabf370ba70f203976fefa94156c48330","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,63,148,203,171,243,112,186,112,242,3,151,111,239,169,65,86,196,131,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
