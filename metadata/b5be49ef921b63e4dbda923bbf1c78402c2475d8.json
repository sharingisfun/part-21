Schlessinger \nEnglish\n1997 \nISBN: 0060173084 \n324 Pages \nPDF \n11.5 MB\n\n\n\n\nShows men how to think through their decisions, restrain their macho impulses, and marry for the right reasons.\n\nEverything will be okay ... once you admit that Dr. Laura's always right. This companion volume to the radio advice factory's 1994 bestseller (which tackled the stupid things women do) serves up plenty of the no-nonsense, old-fashioned morality that her legions of listeners love. Brutally reductive--but not necessarily wrong--this book chalks up men's problems to trying to save &quot;damsels in distress,&quot; refusing to admit to a healthy dependence on others, climbing the career ladder to the detriment of your relationships, denying the duty and pleasure of child-rearing, and many others. Whatever your personal reaction to her brassy, unapologetic style, Dr. Schlessinger is a refreshing antidote to the wishy-washy &quot;everything's relative and everyone's different&quot; trend that held sway for a time. Ten Stupid Things Men Do to Mess up Their Lives contains a lot of good advice--even though it has as much in common with instant soup mix as with therapy.\n\n\n\n[/color][/quote][/b]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5be49ef921b63e4dbda923bbf1c78402c2475d8","amp;dn":"Ten+Stupid+Things+Men+Do+to+Mess+Up+Their+Lives-Mantesh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5be49ef921b63e4dbda923bbf1c78402c2475d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,190,73,239,146,27,99,228,219,218,146,59,191,28,120,64,44,36,117,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
