On December 14, 2009, Ubisoft UK released the first details of the story on their official video portal.\n\nThe game is an interquel, taking place in the seven year gap between The Sands of Time and Prince of Persia: Warrior Within. The Prince character is supposed to be a cross between the character models in these two games. Once again he will be voiced by Yuri Lowenthal.\n\nThe plot of main game, developed for PS3, Xbox 360, and PC, begins as the Prince is riding through a desert on his horse, on a quest to see his brother, Malik, and learn about leadership from him. When the Prince arrives at Malik's kingdom, he finds it under attack by an army who he proposes wants a treasure buried deep within. The Prince infiltrates Malik's kingdom, and meets up with Malik in the treasure vaults.\n\nHere, Malik proposes that he is fighting a losing battle, and needs to rely on a last resort or be forced to retreat. The Prince strongly objects, but Malik releases Solomon's Army using a magical seal. Solomon's Army is an assortment of different creatures, all made of sand, supposedly enough to outnumber the grains of sand in the desert. The Prince and Malik both manage to obtain halves of the seal used to unleash the army, protecting them from being turned into sand statues, which was the fate of the rest of the kingdom. The seals also allow them to absorb the power of the enemies they defeat.\n\nMalik is separated from the Prince, who finds a portal to the domain of Razia, a Djinn. Razia tells the Prince that the only way to reimprison Solomon's Army is to reunite both halves of the seal used to bind them. Razia gives the Prince special powers, and has him set out to find Malik, and the other half of the seal. When the Prince finds Malik, he isn't interested in stopping the Army of Solomon, but instead wants to destroy it and use its power to become more powerful a leader. The Prince finds Razia again, and asks her about this, and she proposes it's an effect of absorbing too much of the power of Solomon's Army, and that the power she gave the Prince offered him protection from this effect.\n\nThe Prince again sets out to find Malik, but this time forcibly take his half of the seal, but Malik is stronger and manages to escape. Pursuing Malik again, the Prince finds Ratash, the leader of Solomon's Army, pursuing anyone in possession of the seal. After the Prince outruns him, he concludes Ratash must now be chasing Malik, and so sets out to aid him. The Prince arrives in the throne room to find Malik and Ratash fighting, and he aids Malik. The Prince and Malik seem to kill Ratash, and Malik absorbs his power, shattering his half of the seal. Malik then runs off, seemingly in a hysterical fit, using some of Ratash's powers to escape.\n\nThe Prince pursues him, and again finds Razia instead. Razia explains that Ratash cannot be killed by any ordinary sword, and that what actually happened was quite different than what the Prince saw. Ratash has actually killed Malik, and possessed his body. The Prince doesn't believe this, but sets out anyways to find the Djinn Sword, which Razia says can kill Ratash.\n\nAlong the way, the Prince chases Ratash, witnessing Ratash gaining so much power back, that he can mutate Malik's body back to his original form. The Prince loses a battle to Ratash and, convinced his brother is in fact dead now, finds the Djinn Sword. With this sword, the Prince again sets out to find Ratash. When he does, Ratash is now gigantic, literally fed by the sandstorm which has come over the palace.\n\nDespite this, the Prince uses the sword to kill Ratash, and when the sandstorm and battle both subside, he finds Malik laying next to him, dying. Malik says to tell their father that Prince will be a mighty leader, then dies. The Prince then sets out to inform his father of Malik's death.\n\n\nMinimum System Requirements:\n============================\n\nOperating System : Microsoft Windows XP (SP3) / Windows Vista (SP2) / Windows 7\nProcessor : Intel Pentium D at 2.6 GHz / AMD Athlon 64 X2 3800+\nVideo Card : 256 MB VRAM ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ DirectX 9.0 compatible video card with Shader Model 3.0 support (**See supported list)\nMemory : 1 GB RAM (XP) / 2 GB RAM (Vista / 7)\nHard Disk : 8 GB of free Hard Drive space\nSound : DirectX 9.0 compatible Sound Card\nDirect X : 9.0c\nControls : Windows compatible Keyboard &amp; Mouse / Controller\nInstallation : DVD-ROM Drive\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                             ***** enjoy ... *****","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6960a5b24cc047cbaa9be8c07a81c7c2ce94e150","amp;dn":"PC+%C3%82%C2%BB+PRINCE+OF+PERSIA+-+THE+FORGOTTEN+SANDS+Full+Game+directpla","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6960a5b24cc047cbaa9be8c07a81c7c2ce94e150","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,96,165,178,76,192,71,203,170,155,232,192,122,129,199,194,206,148,225,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
