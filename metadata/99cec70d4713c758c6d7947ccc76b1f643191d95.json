As well as unseen footage from the BBC One show, Jo and the panel will taste bakes brought in by the studio audience and look at photos of bakes from viewers at home - the stonkers and the stinkers. Jo will interview the last baker to leave before the final.\r\n\r\nWhat will the panel think of the bakers' signature chocolate tarts? Who rose to the chocolate souffle technical? Whose show-stopping 3D chocolate centrepiece was the centre of attention? And which baker will the panel tip to be crowned the Great British Bake Off Champion 2015?\r\n\r\nThe Great British Bake Off: An Extra Slice - when one helping of Bake Off just isn't enough","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:99cec70d4713c758c6d7947ccc76b1f643191d95","amp;dn":"The.Great.British.Bake.Off-An.Extra.Slice-S02E09-360p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"99cec70d4713c758c6d7947ccc76b1f643191d95","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,206,199,13,71,19,199,88,198,215,148,124,204,118,177,246,67,25,29,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
