SpeedFan can even access S.M.A.R.T. info and show hard disk temperatures.\n\nSpeedFan supports SCSI disks too. SpeedFan can even change the FSB on some hardware (but this should be considered a bonus feature).\n\nSpeedFan can access digital temperature sensors and can change fan speeds accordingly, thus reducing noise.\n\nSpeedFan can find almost any hardware monitor chip connected to the 2-wire SMBus (System Management Bus (trademark belonging to SMIF, Inc.), a subset of the I2C protocol) and works fine with Windows 9x, ME, NT, 2000, 2003, XP and Windows Vista. It works with Windows 64 bit too.\n\nSpeedFan can handle:\n\n    * almost any number of South Bridges\n    * almost any number of hardware monitor chips\n    * almost any number of hard disks\n    * almost any number of temperature readings\n    * almost any number of voltage readings\n    * almost any number of fan speed readings\n    * almost any number of PWMs\n\n\n--------\n| More |\n--------\n\nRequirements:\tWindows (All Versions)\nLicense:\tFreeware\n\n\n\nStatus:\n\n--&gt; Seeding: YES\n--&gt; up speed: 6mb\n--&gt; alive: yes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ba91a69bdd772b7916694f235529bdcecdbb187","amp;dn":"%7BF%7D+SpeedFan+4.40","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ba91a69bdd772b7916694f235529bdcecdbb187","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,169,26,105,189,215,114,183,145,102,148,242,53,82,155,220,236,219,177,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
