Each director will give a personal vision of current or future life in this coming cultural melting pot.\n\n\n\nThe conditions are equally simple:\n\n\n\nAbsolute freedom of expression. \n\n\n\nAll films receive the same amount of money ÃƒÆ’?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ regulated to a EU-index. The length of each film is set to five minutes. The shooting format will be compatible to television 16:9. \n\n\n\nWhen the first Nations began working together in the 1950ÃƒÆ’?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s to form what later became the EU, the idea was met with excitement and scepticism. Later other countries joined the community, and at the Copenhagen Summit, the latest enlargement of the EU was confirmed; twenty-five member Nations. \n\n\n\nEnvisioning the collaboration of twenty-five different countries, encompassing an even greater number of languages, could be considered a tremendous and potentially haphazard project. Yet throughout Europe, the number of supporters believing in the idea has constantly balanced the number of sceptics. Regardless of personal leaning, the EU is now a fact of life.\n\n\n\nFocus on the differences and they are there to be seen. Look for similarities and they might just be found.\n\n\n\nEurope is filled with differences, National and regional, urban and agricultural, culinary and cultural, social and political. Some inhabitantsÃƒÆ’?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ travel extensively, others may never leave their home region. Commodities appear from all over the world. Television brings all aspects of existence into our living rooms. Traditions of power, use and misuse, administrative and political influence, taxation, military prowess, Education, health service, crime and crime prevention, foreign affairs, immigration, colonial heritage, wage systems, unemployment benefit, and so on and so forthÃƒÆ’?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ all these aspects are poured into a joint multi-lingual melting pot, and stirred by the hands of a diversity of chefs, with an equal diversity of interest.\n\n\n\nBorders vanish; National currency disappears, sovereign laws and rules become predetermined by common European regulations. A mere glance at the foregoing three hundred years of European history shows an ever-changing map of a fluctuant Europe. The elements of understanding of our personal lives, captured in words like identity, roots, national pride, heritage, and so on, are being affected. \n\n\n\nA small piece of the jigsaw might reflect the whole puzzle. \n\n\n\nThis project hopes that each director will individually grasp whatever piece of the puzzle that attracts them and give us a personal artistic vision of the phenomena called ÃƒÆ’?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½EuropeÃƒÆ’?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½.\n\n\n\nIt is important to underline that this is not a EU project in itself. The aim is neither to promote the EU, nor to deny it.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:35a5a72ce9617750ee4019fe3e87c918a499e2bb","amp;dn":"Visions+of+Europe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"35a5a72ce9617750ee4019fe3e87c918a499e2bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,165,167,44,233,97,119,80,238,64,25,254,62,135,201,24,164,153,226,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
