In his subsequent solo career Osbourne achieved a multi-platinum status in addition to the one he had earned with Black Sabbath. These things are what led Osbourne to become known as the &quot;Godfather of Heavy Metal&quot;. It was during his Sabbath days that, because of their dark style of music, Osbourne became known as the &quot;Prince of Darkness.&quot; Osbourne has over 15 tattoos, the most famous of which are the letters O-Z-Z-Y across the knuckles of his left hand. This was his first tattoo, created by himself as a teenager with a sewing needle and pencil lead.\n\nIn the early 2000s, Osbourne's career expanded to a new medium when he became a star in his own reality show, The Osbournes, alongside wife/manager Sharon and two of their three children, Kelly and Jack. As a solo artist, Osbourne has sold over 32 million albums worldwide.\n\nOsbourne is currently on a worldwide tour to promote his new album Scream, released on 22 June 2010.\n\n\nArtist :  Ozzy Osbourne\n\nTitle : Scream\n\nGenre : Heavy Metal\n\nReleased :  06/22/2010\n\nSummary :\nThe newest album of &quot;Prince of Darkness&quot;\nLuxury Japanese edition with a few extra bonus.\n\nTracklist:\nDISC 1 / 49m:07s :\n01.
