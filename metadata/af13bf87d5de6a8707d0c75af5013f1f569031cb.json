To mark this\n      anniversary  year,  Sue has  given  us  stories that  reveal\n      KinseyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s origins and SueÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s past.\n\n      Kinsey  and  Me  has  two parts:  The  nine  Kinsey  stories\n      (1986-93), each a gem of  detection; and the And Me stories,\n      written in the decade after Grafton's mother died. Together,\n      they  show just  how much  of  Kinsey is  a distillation  of\n      her  creatorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s  past  even  as  they  reveal  a  child  who,\n      free of  parental interventions, read everything  and roamed\n      everywhere. But the dark side  of such freedom was that very\n      parental distance.\n\n      The same  unique voice  and witty  insights readers  fell in\n      love with  in A  Is for Alibi  permeate the  Kinsey stories.\n      Those in the And Me  section trace a remarkable voyage, from\n      anger to understanding, from  pain to forgiveness. They take\n      us into  a troubled  family, dysfunctional as  most families\n      are,  each  in  their  own way,  but  GraftonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s  telling  is\n      sensitive, delicate,  and ultimately, loving.  Enriching the\n      way we  see Kinsey  and know Sue,  these stories  are deeply\n      affecting.\n\n\nA Marian Wood Book/Putnam, 2013.\n\n\n\n-_-","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af13bf87d5de6a8707d0c75af5013f1f569031cb","amp;dn":"Sue+Grafton+-+Kinsey+and+Me%3A+Stories.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af13bf87d5de6a8707d0c75af5013f1f569031cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,19,191,135,213,222,106,135,7,208,199,90,245,1,63,31,86,144,49,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
