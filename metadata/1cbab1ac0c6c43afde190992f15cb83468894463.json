A film celebrating 40 years of the \nFender Stratocaster.\n\nThis is a new digitising of the same VHS file. I would say it is abt\n10% better video then the first one posted. If you already have that \none, don&amp;#039;t bother. Do try to get the earlier version out of circulation.\n\nSorry about the inferior video quality. I had this film on VHS tape for \nmore than 10 years before digitising it. It is a great film though. Far \nbetter than the one they did at 50.\n\nI recorded this one off Swedish Television and the subtitles are in \nSwedish. The soundtrack is the original English.\n\nI have searched wide and far for an original DVD or VHS copy of this\nfilm, and would have been very happy to pay properly for it. But it \nseems there is none to be had yet. In the meantime, enjoy this!\n\nAnd God bless Keith Richards!\n...............\n\nIt seems the chapters menus do not work at all.\n...........\n\nThis is obviously a Divx film. VLC will play it as well, but without\nany menus at all.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1cbab1ac0c6c43afde190992f15cb83468894463","amp;dn":"Curves++contours+and+body+horns%2C+NEW","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1cbab1ac0c6c43afde190992f15cb83468894463","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,186,177,172,12,108,67,175,222,25,9,146,241,92,184,52,104,137,68,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
