G. Wells classic novel follows the story of humanity at the turn of the 20th century as a large cylinder from space falls on the English countryside. A young writer, (anthony Piana) is among those who witness the event. As the cylinder opens, horrifying tentacled creatures from Mars appear and it soon becomes apparent the Martians intend to attack. The quickly mushrooming war separates the writer and his beloved wife (Susan Goforth). He journeys to reunite with her while fighting for his own survival as the military launches counter attacks to stop the Martians. The writer is forced to bare witness as society collapses and the human race uses all of its knowledge and strength to win the war of the worlds.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a2eca9b3940a2d3ebc8b6c3c22d475078d02a2b","amp;dn":"H.G.+Wells%27s+War+of+the+Worlds+%282005%29.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a2eca9b3940a2d3ebc8b6c3c22d475078d02a2b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,46,202,155,57,64,162,211,235,200,182,195,194,45,71,80,120,208,42,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
