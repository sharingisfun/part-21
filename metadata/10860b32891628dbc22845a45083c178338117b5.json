The band existed as a secret hobby band for three years before the album was released in 2007. The album contained ten songs and a bonus DVD with music videos for five songs and the bonus track &quot;Nattportiern&quot;. Jan Gradvall of Dagens Industri described the band's sound as what blues would have sounded like if it would have its roots in Ruhr instead of Memphis.\n\nTrack listing\n\nCD\n482 mHz\nSpÃƒÂ¥r ÃƒÂ¶verallt\nLe Havre\nNordlicht\nRum 212\nHonungsgatan\nRavic\nJÃƒÂ¤rnstaden\n...Den Dan\nHauptbahnhof","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10860b32891628dbc22845a45083c178338117b5","amp;dn":"S%26auml%3Bllskapet+-+2007+-+S%26auml%3Bllskapet","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10860b32891628dbc22845a45083c178338117b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,134,11,50,137,22,40,219,194,40,69,164,80,131,193,120,51,129,23,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
