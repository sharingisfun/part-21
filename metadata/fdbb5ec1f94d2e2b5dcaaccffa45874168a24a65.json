As in, title of this record. &quot;Liquor in the Front...Poker in the Rear.&quot; Get it? I hope so. Juvenille? Yep. Sophmoric? You got it. Tongue planted firmly in cheek? You know it. But who cares?! This is the Reverend Horton Heat! He's out to burn up your house party with his unique brand of rockabilly on steroids. And that's a good thing. No, strike that. It's a great thing! We NEED this music. And Jim Heath delivers.\n\n&quot;Liquor in the Front&quot; features 13 tracks produced by industrial king, Al Jourgensen. He of Ministry &amp; Revolting Cocks fame. He brings a lil' bit of a left turn to the recording but it's still The Rev. &amp; still amazing.\nAmped-up tracks like &quot;Big Sky,&quot; &quot;Cruisin' for a Bruisin',&quot; and &quot;I Can't Surf&quot; will make your ears bleed red. While &quot;Baddest of the Bad,&quot; &quot;Liquor, Beer &amp; Wine&quot; and &quot;The Entertainer&quot; will make you grin from ear to ear as you polish off another gin &amp; tonic.
