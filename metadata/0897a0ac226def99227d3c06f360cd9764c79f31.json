No disrespect for the games, but that just is not what this torrent is for.\n\n\nI really did try to obtain only full versions, but sadly this was an impossibility. A few of the games are demos/betas. \n\nI attempted to group the games by 'waves' to sort of briefly describe what the gameplay would be like. First Wave would be the most basic, while Third Wave would be the most complex. \n\nThe games had to be archived because it had too many files. You will need an archiving program to unzip the files, I recommend 7zip (http://www.7-zip.org/). \n\nI know you probably have half of these games already, but please, download the whole thing and seed if possible. I do recommend copying and pasting the files into a separate directory, as to not disturb the seeding process. \n\nDo not post comments asking to seed, be patient. \n\nThis torrent has been full AND boot scanned by Avast!, with no malicious files detected. Please do scan the files with your preferred scanner, and post the results(IF THERE IS A MALICIOUS FILE).\n\nI would also appreciate it, if you were to post the title of a shooter you feel should be added to the torrent that was not present. I most likely missed a few, and will eventually(as in, not immediately) update the compilation through separate torrents.\n\nTorrent includes:\n\n1st Wave: \n\nBattlezone +\nCastle Master +\nCybercon 3\nCyber-Cop\nEye Of The Beholder\nFaceball 2000\nHovertank 3D\nMidwinter +\nMobile Suit Z Gundam - Hot Scramble\nSpace School Simulator - The Academy\nStar Cruiser\nTerminator 2029\nWaxWorks\nXenocide\n\n\n2nd Wave: \n\nAlien Cabal\nBad Toys 3D\nBlake Stone +\nBloodshot - Battle Frenzy\nBobenstein 3D (Demo)\nCatacomb +\nCorridor 7 + 8\nDepth Dwellers\nEscape From Monster Manor - A Terrifying Hunt For The Undead\nH.U.R.L.\nIn Extremis\nIsle Of The Dead\nKen's Labyrinth\nLethal Tender\nMr. Pibb: The 3D Interactive Game\nNerves Of Steel\nNitemare 3D\nOperation Body Count\nPathways Into Darkness\nRobocop 3\nSuper Noah's Ark 3D\nTerminal Terror\nThe Fortress Of Doctor Radiaki\nThe Terminator - Rampage \nThor's Hammer\nUltima Underworld +\nWilliam Shatner's Tek War\nWolfenstein +\n\n\n3rd Wave: \n\nAlien Trilogy\nAlien vs Predator \nAlpha Storm\nAshes To Ashes - Feeding The Fires Of War\nAssassin 2015\nBlood\nCybermage - Darklight Awakening\nCyClones\nDamage Incorporated\nDescent +\nDisruptor \nDoom 64\nDuke Nukem 3D + \nEradicator\nFate (Demo)\n(GZDoom) Action Doom 2 \n(GZDoom) Blasphemer \n(GZDoom) Chex Quest + \n(GZDoom) Doom +\n(GZDoom) Final Doom + \n(GZDoom) FreeDoom \n(GZDoom) HacX \n(GZDoom) Harmony \n(GZDoom) Heretic - Shadow Of The Serpent Riders\n(GZDoom) Hexen + \n(GZDoom) Strife \nImmercenary\nIn Pursuit Of Greed\nJumping Flash!\nKileak - The DNA Imperative\nKilling Time\nLegend Of The 7 Paladins\nNecrodome\nOutlaws\nPO'ed\nPowerslave/Exhumed\nPrime Target (Demo)\nQuarantine +\nQuiver\nRebel Moon +\nRedneck Rampage +\nRise Of The Triad\nRobotica\nShadow Warrior +\nStar Wars: Dark Forces\nSystem Shock \nTerminator: Future shock + Skynet\nThe Elder Scrolls +\nThe Hidden Below\nThe Marathon Trilogy \nWitchaven +\nWrath Of Earth\nZero Population Count\nZero Tolerance\n\n\nObscene Wave: PORNOSHOOTERS\n\nDuke Screwem\nImmoral Cumbat\nRodger Ramrod (Demo)\n\n\nKey: \nPluses (+) indicate sequels/add ons of the games that are included (that I know of).\nGZDoom runs MULTIPLE games.
