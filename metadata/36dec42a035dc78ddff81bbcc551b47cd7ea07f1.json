If you get a message about INI file maintenance, usually there is no need to worry. It just cleared out some invalid lines. If your profiles are still there, youâ€™re all set.\r\n- The Monitoring Tool can now work without a direct connection to the monitored clients. You can monitor a Syncovery schedulerâ€™s activity on any machine. Status information and commands are exchanged via a central storage (such as FTP). The feature is documented on the Monitoring Tool dialog (File-&gt;Monitoring Tool in Syncovery). All settings, passwords etc. are made there. The INI file section [CentralManagementSharedSettings] is then copied to clientsâ€™ INI files to enable them to be monitored. Commands sent to clients are signed with PGP in order to prevent misuse.\r\n- You can specify status upload delays and specify how frequently clients should check for commands. Because there is no direct connection, status information will be delayed by a few seconds, and commands will only take effect after a few minutes, depending on your settings.\r\n- It will be possible to monitor the next Macintosh and Linux versions also, but the Monitoring Tool itself is Windows only. \r\n\r\nAbout Syncovery Pro Enterprise\r\n\r\nBack up your data and synchronize PCs, Macs, servers, notebooks, and online storage space.\r\n\r\nYou can set up as many different jobs as you need and run them manually or using the scheduler.\r\nSyncovery works with local hard drives, network drives and any other mounted volumes.\r\nIn addition, it comes with support for FTP, SSH, HTTP, WebDAV, Amazon S3, Google Drive, Microsoft Azure, SugarSync, box.net and many other cloud storage providers.\r\nYou can use ZIP compression and data encryption.\r\nOn Windows, the scheduler can run as a service â€“ without users having to log on.\r\nThere are powerful synchronization modes, including Standard Copying, Exact Mirror, and SmartTracking.\r\n\r\nSyncovery features a carefully designed GUI to make it an extremely versatile synchronizing and backup tool.\r\nThe wealth of features fulfills all requirements that users typically have, while still being easy to use.\r\n\r\nHomepage https://www.syncovery.com/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36dec42a035dc78ddff81bbcc551b47cd7ea07f1","amp;dn":"Syncovery+Pro+Enterprise+7.50+Build+360+%28Install+%2B+Portable%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36dec42a035dc78ddff81bbcc551b47cd7ea07f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,222,196,42,3,93,199,141,223,248,27,188,197,81,180,124,215,234,7,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
