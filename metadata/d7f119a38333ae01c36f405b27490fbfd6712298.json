Readers accompany the stray as he navigates dog society, weathers pack politics, and surveys canine-human interactions.\n\nGood Dog's story and pen-and-ink art are deceptively simple, but Chaffee uses the approachability of the subject matter as a device to explore topics such as independence, security, assimilation, loyalty, and violence. Preteen-and-up dog fanciers, especially, will warm to the well-meaning Ivan and his exploits with a motley assortment of Scotties, Bulldogs, and mutts. Chaffee combines illustrative gravitas with cartooning verve and creates a richly textured, dogÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s-eye view of the world. The story is a rousing Jack London-esque adventure as well as a moral parable","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7f119a38333ae01c36f405b27490fbfd6712298","amp;dn":"Good+Dog+%282013%29+%28Digital%29+%28Emachine-Empire%29.cbr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7f119a38333ae01c36f405b27490fbfd6712298","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,241,25,163,131,51,174,1,195,111,64,91,39,73,15,191,214,113,34,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
