Just sit back and the bootable ISO image file will be created automatically within a few minutes which can be burned on a disk using any CD/DVD burning software.\n\nInstructions:\n=============\n1. Create a folder on your desktop. (For simplicity, i'll name this folder 'EXTRACTED').\n2. Extract the contents of your downloaded Windows .ISO image to the folder named 'EXTRACTED' using e.g. PowerISO.\n3. Create a 2nd folder on your desktop. (For simplicity, i'll name it 'COMPILED').\n4. Run WBICreator.\n5. From the 1st drop down menu, select the O/S type (For simplicity, i'll be using Windows 7).\n6. In the 'CD/DVD Label' window, name it what you like.\n7. In the 'Setup Location' window, navigate to and select the 'EXTRACTED' folder.\n8. In the 'Output Path' navigate to and select the 'COMPILED' folder.\n9. Click 'GO'.\n10. Once the process has finished, a bootable Windows 7 .ISO has been created in the folder named 'COMPILED'.\n11. Now just burn the image to disk using e.g. PowerISO.\n\nJOB DONE!!!\n\n2010kaiser home page at The Pirate Bay link below:\n\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2010kaiser/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2010kaiser/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nCheck out the new PirateWiki!
