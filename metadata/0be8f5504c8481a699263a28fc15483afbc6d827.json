The recordings were made in the 80s and 90s and were released by L'Oiseau-Lyre as a double CD in 1997. These brilliant performances are perfect for those who wish to hear these familiar pieces on period instruments.\n\nPlease enjoy.\n\nMP3 @ 320","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0be8f5504c8481a699263a28fc15483afbc6d827","amp;dn":"Schubert+-+Chamber+Music+-+Hogwood%2C+AAM+Chamber+Ensemble","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0be8f5504c8481a699263a28fc15483afbc6d827","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,232,245,80,76,132,129,166,153,38,58,40,252,21,72,58,251,198,216,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
