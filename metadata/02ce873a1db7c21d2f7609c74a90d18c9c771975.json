Why didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t they blow the whistle?\n\nAs the country marks the tenth anniversary of the U.S. invasion of Iraq, a nagging question lingers: Why didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t those in the U.S governmentÃ¢â‚¬â€who knew the truthÃ¢â‚¬â€speak out about the phony intelligence being used by the Bush White House to justify the invasion of Iraq? Yellowcake uranium from Africa? Aluminum tubes for a nuclear weapons program? Connections between al Qaeda and Saddam? Throughout the U.S. intelligence community, some officials knew that theseÃ¢â‚¬â€œand other assertions used to make the case for warÃ¢â‚¬â€œwere based on the sketchiest of intelligence, wrong-headed assumptions and fraudulent claims. Yet those officials didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t go public, their doubts recorded only in dissents buried deep inside a classified National Intelligence Estimate that never saw the light of day. In these excerpts from interviews conducted for Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hubris,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ some of the principals explain why so many remained silent about issues that were so important.\n\nMark Rossini was a former FBI counter-terrorism agent assigned to the unit that specialized in al Qaeda. In 2001, he was detailed to the CIA Counter-Terrorism Center where he was tasked with analyzing a Czech intelligence report that 9/11 hijacker Mohammed Atta had met with an  Iraqi intelligence officer in PragueÃ¢â‚¬â€œa meeting that Vice President Dick Cheney said on Meet the Press was Ã¢â‚¬Å“pretty well confirmed.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Rossini quickly helped debunk the report and, he says in Hubris, was aghast that Cheney was giving it credence. Ã¢â‚¬Å“In hindsight, I do wish that me or somebody else did say, Ã¢â‚¬Ëœwait a second, this is totally wrong.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nHubris: Selling the Iraq War\n\nMSNBC Documentary\nHosted by:  Rachel Maddow\n\nOriginally Aired:  Frbruary 19, 2013\nRe-Aired: March 22, 2013\n\nTalking Hubris\nMSNBC Special\nHosted by: Chris Hayes\nAired following Hubris' re-airing.\n\nBoth are XVID video w MP3 audio.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02ce873a1db7c21d2f7609c74a90d18c9c771975","amp;dn":"Hubris+-+Selling+The+Iraq+War","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02ce873a1db7c21d2f7609c74a90d18c9c771975","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,206,135,58,29,183,194,29,47,118,9,199,74,144,209,140,156,119,25,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
