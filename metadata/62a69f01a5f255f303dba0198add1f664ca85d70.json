We here at Sub Pop could think of no better way to do so than by putting out as many Mudhoney records as possible. So, this May, weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re releasing an excellent, new Mudhoney album called The Lucky Ones and also this deluxe, remastered edition of Superfuzz Bigmuff (which, unfortunately, we failed to convince the band to call Superduperfuzz Biggermuff??ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦). Here you will find: the original ??SuperfuzzÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ EP in its correct running order, singles, demos, and two blistering live recordings from 1988, all remastered, or in some cases, mastered for the very first time. There are four (4) different versions of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMudrideÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ here.\n\nJay Hinman in the liner notes for the deluxed-up SuperfuzzÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMy feelingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and I know IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m not alone in this oneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½is that for all the play and worldwide attention several Seattle-area bands got during the 1988-92 period, at the end of the day (and even at the time), there was MudhoneyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and then there was everybody else. To me, you, and most everyone who was paying close attention to underground rock music during those years, Mudhoney still sound like the undisputed kingpins of roaring, surging, fuzzed-out, punk rock music. These first recordings were so life-affirming upon their release, connecting everything great about the sixties (biker movies, fuzzboxes, old guitars, three-minute songs) with the frothing, punk rock of the early ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“80s, that a whole new ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œstyleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ of music was born. They called it grunge, but to me it was amped-up, clear-the-room, ramalama rock that exploded like Nagasaki live, and it was about as joyous and as fun a noise as anyoneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d heard in years.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nStill is.\n\n\nCD 1\n\n01.
