This is my first attempt at a torrent, so bear\nwith me.  I loaded this up to promote the works of Joe and\nthis great album; it's very well recorded and if you play \nthese lossless files through a good hifi system it will \nsound excellent.\n\nIf you like Joe's music, then please support him by buying\nsome of his music CDs or go to his concerts like I have done.\n\nOriginal CD has been ripped with xAct with zero errors, some\nlog files attached.\n\nThis torrent will not be top 40 (!) so please help keep it\nalive by reseeding - more than 1.0 seed ratio if you can\nplease.
