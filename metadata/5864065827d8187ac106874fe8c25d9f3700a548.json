A Tribute To Nat King Cole\n\nGeorge Benson (born March 22, 1943) is a ten-time Grammy Award-winning American musician and singer-songwriter. He began his professional career at twenty-one, as a jazz guitarist. Benson uses a rest-stroke picking technique similar to that of gypsy jazz players such as Django Reinhardt.\n\nA former child prodigy, Benson first came to prominence in the 1960s, playing soul jazz with Jack McDuff and others. He then launched a successful solo career, alternating between jazz, pop, R&amp;B singing, and scat singing. His album Breezin' was certified triple-platinum on the Billboard 200 chart in 1976. His concerts were well attended through the 1980s, and still has a large following. He has received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame\n\n\nBackground information\n\n\nBorn\nMarch 22, 1943 \nPittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States \n\nGenres\nJazz, funk, rhythm and blues, soul \n\nOccupations\nMusician, singer-songwriter \n\nInstruments\nVocals, guitar, archtop guitar \n\nYears active\n1954 (as little George Benson)\n 1963Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent \n\nLabels\nPrestige Records (1964Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1965)\nColumbia Records (1966Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1967)\nVerve Records (1968)\nA&amp;M Records (1968Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1970)\nCTI Records (1971Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1976)\nWarner Bros.
