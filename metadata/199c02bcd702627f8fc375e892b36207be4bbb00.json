She dies and her baby is in critical condition. The baby has to be kept in a neonatal incubator. When the hurricane strikes, all the power goes out and everyone in the hospital leaves. But the baby's father stays because the baby can't be moved so he has to take care of his baby by making sure the ventilator stays on. And because there's no power, the only power source is generator that he has to crank every few minutes. So he has to stay awake while waiting for someone to come for them.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:199c02bcd702627f8fc375e892b36207be4bbb00","amp;dn":"Hours+2013+480p+WEBRip+x264+DraEMnC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"199c02bcd702627f8fc375e892b36207be4bbb00","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,156,2,188,215,2,98,127,143,195,117,232,146,179,98,7,190,75,187,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
