Selling more than one million copies through five editions, it has provided generations of investors with the timeless value investing philosophy and techniques of Benjamin Graham and David L. Dodd.\n\nAs relevant today as when they first appeared nearly 75 years ago, the teachings of Benjamin Graham, Ã¢â‚¬Å“the father of value investing,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ have withstood the test of time across a wide diversity of market conditions, countries, and asset classes.\n\nThis new sixth edition, based on the classic 1940 version, is enhanced with 200 additional pages of commentary from some of todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s leading Wall Street money managers. These masters of value investing explain why the principles and techniques of Graham and Dodd are still highly relevant even in todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vastly different markets.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ee5c0c6cb8dc1d684803cd8a9156e3963c1a73d","amp;dn":"Security.Analysis..Sixth.Edition.Foreword.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ee5c0c6cb8dc1d684803cd8a9156e3963c1a73d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,229,192,198,203,141,193,214,132,128,60,216,169,21,110,57,99,193,167,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
