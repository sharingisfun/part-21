Director Frank Marshall stages the mountaintop crash with a terrifying sequence of special effects and makes sure that the subsequent events are tastefully presented. He's well served by the convincing performances of a cast that includes Ethan Hawke and Vincent Spano. However, given the grim subject matter, you can't help but keep your emotional distance from the survivors' dreadful dilemma.\n\nAspect Ratio: 720 x 576 : 16:9 Anamorphic Widescreen\n\nVideo: H.264 High Profile : 1000kbps 25fps : 2 Pass Encoded\n\nAudio: AAC-LC 48000Hz 128kbps ABR Stereo\n\nMD5 Checksum: 80F6DED295D1C91575C2D36FC303BFCD\n\n[Frank_UK]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4318df8d4d83ee9e6d16639840b0ad7f03f00c60","amp;dn":"Alive+%5B1993%5D+%5BFilm+4%5D+%5BH.264%5D+%5BFrank_UK%5D.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4318df8d4d83ee9e6d16639840b0ad7f03f00c60","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,24,223,141,77,131,238,158,109,22,99,152,64,176,173,127,3,240,12,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
