This infectious sound and style has made it's way onto the dance floors of artists ranging from KOAN Sound to Skrillex. Naturally with such success, a follow up to the original release was a must. Alas, Caliber Music delivers the &quot;Let's Call It Neurohop&quot; LP: Volume Two! Once again featuring extremely innovative producers spanning a gamut of bass music influences, Caliber gathers 10 tracks focusing on neuro style production. From extremely tech artists such as Kursa and Audeka, to the sub woofer destroyers like Disprove and Skope, Neurohop continues to infiltrate and grow at an alarming rate, converting nonbelievers, speaker by speaker, bassline by bassline. Working hard in continuing to push the envelope, Caliber Music maintains it's sharp focus on delivering quality bass music.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.beatport.com/release/lets-call-it-neurohop-vol-2/1151837&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.beatport.com/release/lets-call-it-neurohop-vol-2/1151837&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81ceb3555808101e5de4654aebd67e9af356896f","amp;dn":"VA+-+Let%27s+Call+It+Neurohop+Vol.+2+%282013%29+FLAC+mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81ceb3555808101e5de4654aebd67e9af356896f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,206,179,85,88,8,16,30,93,228,101,74,235,214,126,154,243,86,137,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
