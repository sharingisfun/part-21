We might think we know who first said famous for fifteen minutes, annus horribilis, the cold war and let them eat cake. It's a no brainer, you might say, but Max Cryer has a surprise or two in store for you. I kid you not. In this very readable book, he explores the origins of hundreds of expressions we use and hear every day and comes up with some surprising findings. Never economical with the truth, he might just have the last laugh.\n\n\n# Paperback: 404 pages\n# Publisher: ReadHowYouWant; Large Print 16 pt edition (March 18, 2011)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 1458785599\n# ISBN-13: 978-1458785596","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3faf3828b23ffce137ce745d8f981681793dc987","amp;dn":"Who+Said+That+First%3F+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3faf3828b23ffce137ce745d8f981681793dc987","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,175,56,40,178,63,252,225,55,206,116,93,143,152,22,129,121,61,201,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
