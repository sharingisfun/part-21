There was an issue with the LIVE-stream from hbo tonite where frame rate was off resulting in audio being oos for the first three minutes and because the stream itself was choppy for the first 4 minutes I couldn't fix it and had to wait for hbo to post the segment. This encode still contains the extra new rules segment from the live stream because that was fine. I hope y'all don't mind the delay for a quality release. This is the second week in a row that this has happened and I hope that next week this issue won't repeat. Either way, here's tonite's OVERTIME - Peace \n\nEXTRA NOTES: PLEASE DO NOT ASK FOR MAIN PORTION OF SHOW! I DO NOT HAVE HBO AND, THEREFORE, CAN NOT RIP THE MAIN SHOW, but I am able to capture the overtime stream, live, when it airs on the hbo website. This is released for those that are in countries that can't access hbo,etc. or want the convenience of watching it back-2-back in-player. When MAIN PORTION of show is released WE WILL ALL KNOW :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3729da5e31e3970f9f2659a1034fbb215a32303b","amp;dn":"Real.Time.With.Bill.Maher.JUST.OVERTIME.2013.11.08.WEB-DL.Shadoe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3729da5e31e3970f9f2659a1034fbb215a32303b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,41,218,94,49,227,151,15,159,38,89,161,3,79,187,33,90,50,48,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
