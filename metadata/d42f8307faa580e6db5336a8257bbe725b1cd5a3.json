Frankly considering one might only ever use their site that one time for that one file, I fail to see it being worth the 5 dollars. That money would be better off donated to Demonoid here. But I digress...\n\nThis file will patch I76 of any version, though it was initially for the gold edition/arsenal. Many people have said it is a necessary patch in the process of getting Interstate 76 to run stable under windows XP. I figured people might appreciate this considering how many have been getting I76 lately.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d42f8307faa580e6db5336a8257bbe725b1cd5a3","amp;dn":"Interstate+76+D3D+Patch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d42f8307faa580e6db5336a8257bbe725b1cd5a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,47,131,7,250,165,128,230,219,83,54,168,37,123,190,114,91,28,213,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
