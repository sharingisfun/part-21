New episodes are broadcast initially on BBC Four on Friday evenings at 22:30 and repeated on BBC Two the following Friday at 22:00. Syndicated episodes of previous series are shown on Dave. QI has the highest viewing figures for any show on BBC Four and Dave.[1][2]\n\nIt is distinguished by the awarding of points not necessarily for correct answers, but rather, for (quite) interesting ones. Many of the questions are extremely obscure, making it unlikely that the correct answer will be given. Points are deducted from a panellist who gives an obvious but wrong answer, typically one that is generally accepted as true but is, in fact, false. Davies is usually in last place in the show as he consistently gives answers like these.\n\t\t\n\nSEASON 1\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b374b7e120c776632e25fe2af9dfd731fa3c7d56","amp;dn":"QI+Quite+Interesting+Season+1+BBC+UK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b374b7e120c776632e25fe2af9dfd731fa3c7d56","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,116,183,225,32,199,118,99,46,37,254,42,249,223,215,49,250,60,125,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
