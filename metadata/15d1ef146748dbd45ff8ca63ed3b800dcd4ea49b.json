Metaphysical Foundations of Natural Science (1786)...  On a Discovery whereby Any New Critique of Pure Reason Is to Be Made SuperÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¬Ã¢â‚¬Å¡uous by an Older One (1790)... What Real Progress Has Metaphysics Made in Germany since the Time of Leibniz and Wolff? (written during 1793ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“4, but only published after KantÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s death in 1804)... and the companion pieces: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œOn a Recently Prominent Tone of Superiority in PhilosophyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œProclamation of the Imminent Conclusion of a Treaty of Perpetual Peace in PhilosophyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (1796)\n\nTogether these writings constitute only a small portion of KantÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s total\noutput after 1781... Nevertheless, at least the ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¬Ã‚ï¿½rst four of\nthe works translated in this volume constitute an important segment of\nKantÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s overall production during this period, since they are the texts in\nwhich we ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¬Ã‚ï¿½nd him both developing and reÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¬Ã‚ï¿½ning points initially made in\nthe Critique of Pure Reason and defending his views against attacks from a\nnumber of directions. Clearly, the second edition of the Critique of Pure\nReason (1787) belongs to this category as well; but since it is contained\nin the volume devoted to the Critique itself, it will not be discussed here\nin any detail.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:15d1ef146748dbd45ff8ca63ed3b800dcd4ea49b","amp;dn":"Immanuel+Kant+-+Theoretical+Philosophy+After+1781","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"15d1ef146748dbd45ff8ca63ed3b800dcd4ea49b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,209,239,20,103,72,219,212,95,248,202,99,237,59,128,13,205,78,164,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
