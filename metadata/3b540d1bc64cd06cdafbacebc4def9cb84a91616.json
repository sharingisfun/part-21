The internationally known characters cover a range of historical periods, and each had an enormous influence on British history. \r\nThe series is presented by enthusiastic and engaging military expert Major Gordon Corrigan. Though each episode is stand alone, across the series Corrigan also address broader questions about what makes a great commander, allowing modern parallels to be drawn. Commanders featured are Henry V, the Duke of Marlborough, Admiral Nelson, General Douglas Haig, Oliver Cromwell and the Duke Of Wellington.\r\n\r\nProduced &amp; Directed by Emma Hawley ; A Granada Production for Five\r\n\r\n1)  Henry V \r\nMajor Gordon Corrigan presents a profile of King Henry V, whose victory over the French at the Battle of Agincourt in 1415 was the pinnacle of a military career that began when he was just 16. In the clash British troops were outnumbered five to one, but devastated the enemy thanks to their superior training and the King's ruthless tactics.\r\nThe key to Henry's success as a military commander was that he put the English army on a professional footing. He defeated the Welsh and then the French, despite being totally outnumbered. He was the first English monarch who really understood how an army works.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a8/Great-British-Commanders-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/cc/Great-British-Commanders-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/89/Great-British-Commanders-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d2/Great-British-Commanders-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f6/Great-British-Commanders-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/96/Great-British-Commanders-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/6e/Great-British-Commanders-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/3a/Great-British-Commanders-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a5/Great-British-Commanders-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/25/Great-British-Commanders-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/62/Great-British-Commanders-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/cb/Great-British-Commanders-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/51/Great-British-Commanders-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f9/Great-British-Commanders-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/4c/Great-British-Commanders-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f2/Great-British-Commanders-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\r\nVideo Bitrate: 2527 kbps\r\nVideo Resolution: 720x464\r\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.552:1\r\nFrames Per Second: 25.000\r\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\r\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\r\nAudio Streams: 2\r\nAudio Languages: english\r\nRunTime Per Part: 23 min\r\nNumber Of Parts: 6\r\nPart Size: 449 MB\r\nRipped by: DocFreak08\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\nSource: \nhttp://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=Great_British_Commanders","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b540d1bc64cd06cdafbacebc4def9cb84a91616","amp;dn":"Ch5+Great+British+Commanders+1of6+Henry+V+XviD+AC3+MVGroup.org","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b540d1bc64cd06cdafbacebc4def9cb84a91616","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,84,13,27,198,76,208,108,218,251,172,235,196,222,249,203,132,169,22,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
