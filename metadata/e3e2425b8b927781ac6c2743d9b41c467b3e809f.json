They agree that 200 years should be a reasonable margin of safety to stay underground. The box is thrust into the hands of the mayor of the underground complex. Each mayor, in turn, passes the box onto his or her successor. When the box has 47 more years left on the time-lock, the mayor holding the box dies suddenly. It seems the significance of the box had not been explained to anyone because the box is just put at the back of a junk-filled closet. When it finally reaches year 200, the time-lock clicks open, but the event goes unnoticed. For generations, the people of Ember have lived in a huge underground complex built as a refuge for humanity. It is built into a vast cavern so high that it is filled with regular-sized buildings. Far above the tops of the buildings are banks of floodlights that light the city during the day and provide light for the greenhouses. The lights are powered by a massive generator. Now it is year 247 and Ember threatens to fall into darkness as the generator begins to fail. Blackouts are occurring with increasing frequency and last longer each time. There's also a major shortage of canned goods and light bulbs.\n\nGenre: Adventure | Family | Fantasy\n\nRelease date: 10 October 2008 (UK)\n\ncast\n\n# Saoirse Ronan as Lina Mayfleet, descendant of the 7th Mayor of Ember\n# Harry Treadaway as Doon Harrow\n# Bill Murray as Mayor Cole\n# Toby Jones as Barton Snode, assistant to Mayor Cole\n# Marianne Jean-Baptiste as Clary\n# Martin Landau as Sul, technician in the Pipeworks and mentor to Doon\n# Tim Robbins as Loris 'Barrow' Harrow, Doon's father\n# Liz Smith as Granny Mayfleet\n\n::General::\n\nComplete name: City of Ember 720p BRrip\nFormat: Matroska\nFile size: 1732.91 MiB\nDuration: 1h 34mn\nOverall bit rate: 2 558 Kbps\n\nContainer: AVC\nVideo Codec Type: x264 - core 114 r1913 5fd3dce\nAverage video bitrate: [/b]\n[b]Frame Rate: 24.000 fps\nEncoding type: 2 Pass\nDisplay Aspect Ratio: 2.35:1\nResolution: 1280x544\nSource: Blu-ray\n\nAudio Language: English\nAudio Codec: AAC\nBitrate: %Audio_Bitrate%\nChannel Count: 6 channels\nSample Rate: 48.0 KHz\n\nGREETZ: To all my fellow HDScene Encoders, DarkScene, blackjesus and all other Releasers we respect....You know who you are.\n\nscreens\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/93199542145291838226.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/93199542145291838226.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/66879107643512865492.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/66879107643512865492.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/85456301748478457476.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/85456301748478457476.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/13188779595562205173.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/13188779595562205173.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/30272169680426510743.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/30272169680426510743.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\ntrackers\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://exodus.1337x.org/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://exodus.1337x.org/announce&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://genesis.1337x.org:1337/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://genesis.1337x.org:1337/announce&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://exodus.1337x.org/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://exodus.1337x.org/announce&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.pow7.com/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.pow7.com/announce&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://t1.pow7.com:80/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://t1.pow7.com:80/announce&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.publicbt.com:80/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.publicbt.com:80/announce&lt;/a&gt;\n\nInfo Hash:E3E2425B8B927781AC6C2743D9B41C467B3E809F\n\nFollow us on Facebook                    \n\nFollow us on Twitter                      \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3e2425b8b927781ac6c2743d9b41c467b3e809f","amp;dn":"City+of+Ember+720p+BRrip+x264+acc+vice+%28HDScene+Release%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3e2425b8b927781ac6c2743d9b41c467b3e809f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,226,66,91,139,146,119,129,172,108,39,67,217,180,28,70,123,62,128,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
