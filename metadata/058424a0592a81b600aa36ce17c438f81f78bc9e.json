It starred Seth Green and a hand puppet named Greg the Bunny, originally invented by the team of Sean S. Baker, Spencer Chinoy and Dan Milano. Milano and Chinoy wrote and co-produced the Fox show. In the show, Greg was the co-star of a children\\'s television show called Sweetknuckle Junction. Like The Muppet Show, Greg the Bunny treated puppets as though they were real creatures within the reality of the show, although in this show, they were treated as a racial minority, sometimes struggling against second-class citizenship. The show was spun off from The Greg the Bunny Show, a series of short segments that used to air on the Independent Film Channel, which were based on the cable access show Junktape.\n\nCast ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“\nSeth Green as Jimmy Bender \nEugene Levy as Gil Bender \nSarah Silverman as Alison Kaiser \nDan Milano as Greg the Bunny / Warren DeMontague (Professor Ape) (voices) \nDrew Massey as Count Blah / Dr. Aben Mitchell / Gay Bear / Herbitta Hymina (voices) \nBob Gunton as \\&quot;Junction\\&quot; Jack Mars \nDina Spybey as Dottie Sunshine \nTim Curry as Cranky (voice) \nVictor Yerrid as Tardy The Turtle / Mr. Hygiene \nJames Murray as Rochester Rabbit / Susan the Monster / Jamaican Guy (voices)\n\nList of Episodes &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Greg_The_Bunny_episodes&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Greg_The_Bunny_episodes&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:058424a0592a81b600aa36ce17c438f81f78bc9e","amp;dn":"Greg+the+Bunny+%28Complete+TV+Series%29+%5B13+Episodes+%C3%A2%E2%82%AC%E2%80%9C+2+DVD+Extra","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"058424a0592a81b600aa36ce17c438f81f78bc9e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,132,36,160,89,42,129,182,0,170,54,206,23,196,56,248,31,120,188,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
