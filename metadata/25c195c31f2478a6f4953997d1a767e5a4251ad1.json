By special edition, I mean that this album is newly remastered and contains bits of narration that was used for T.S.O.'s concerts when they played &quot;BLN&quot; in full. It makes the concept much clearer and makes for a more fun experience (for me at least, love both versions of this album, this one the most).\n\nIt all has a CBR of 320.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                 Track Listing\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDisc 1:\n\n1.
