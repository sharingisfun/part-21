Writing credits are shared by all five band members, George Harrison, Jeff Lynne, Roy Orbison, Tom Petty, and Bob Dylan.\n\nThe single reached #45 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, #2 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, #21 on the UK singles chart and #3 on the ARIA Chart.\n\nThe song was originally intended as the B-side of Harrison's &quot;This is Love&quot;. Harrison had not yet written a song for the B-side when an impromptu gathering of the musicians who became the Wilburys turned into an informal songwriting and jam session. Casting about for a song idea while relaxing in a garden near Bob Dylan's recording studio, Harrison was inspired when he noticed a box in Dylan's garage that was labelled &quot;Handle with Care&quot;. The box also inspired the opening line: &quot;been beat up and battered around.&quot; The complete song quickly followed, with different members of the gathering contributing various lines. The group moved to a recording studio and quickly laid down the basic tracks which were later polished by eventual Wilburys producer Jeff Lynne.\n\nHarrison's record company decided that the song was too good to be released as &quot;filler.&quot; Encouraged by this response and the enjoyable experience of recording together, the group re-convened to record the first Wilburys album, which featured &quot;Handle With Care&quot; as the lead track.\n\nTraveling Wilburys Vol. 1 is the debut album by the supergroup Traveling Wilburys and was recorded and released in 1988 to commercial success and critical acclaim.\n\nReleased October 18, 1988, Volume One became the surprise hit of the year, selling two million copies within six months. Although the single &quot;Handle With Care&quot; did not scale the pop charts (it stalled at US #45), the album did, reaching #16 in the UK and an impressive #3 in the US. With over fifty weeks on the charts, the album was later certified triple-platinum. While Harrison and Petty had had recent successes, Dylan, Orbison and Lynne had not seen an album climb that high in several years. At the time, no Dylan album had ever achieved two million in sales. As one critic put it, it was &quot;one of the great commercial coups of the decade.&quot;\n\nMost critics said the group's modest ambitions were fresh and relaxing. During 1989 and 1990 the album won many accolades, including a Grammy for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group.\n\nOrbison died suddenly of a heart attack on 6 December 1988.\n\nAfter George HarrisonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s distribution deal with Warner Bros. expired in 1995, ownership of the Dark Horse Records catalog as well as the two Traveling Wilburys albums reverted to Harrison and the albums went out of print. On June 12, 2007, Volume One and Vol. 3 were re-issued by Rhino Records as The Traveling Wilburys Collection, packaged together with bonus tracks and a DVD. The box set debuted at #1 on the UK Albums Chart and at #9 on The Billboard 200.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa486bf2fa1983c7e3bf735d676cbbc189172d7d","amp;dn":"The+Traveling+Wilburys+-+Handle+With+Care+%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa486bf2fa1983c7e3bf735d676cbbc189172d7d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,72,107,242,250,25,131,199,227,191,115,93,103,108,187,193,137,23,45,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
