Enjoy...\n\nCorporation Nation Master\nIntroduction - The New Problem with No Name\n\nThe corporate mystique is a set of cherished beliefs and illusions at the very heart of American culture.  We are all, in some measure, captives of the new mystique, which is at the root of the way we think about the most important institutions in our society-chief among them corporations themselves.  The corporate mystique dictates how we think about not only what corporations are and the importance of their roles in our lives, but what government and markets, business and democracy, and the good life are all about.  It is the main recipe for how to live and think in a corporate world.  \n\nCorporation Nation 2:\nThe Great Pension Fund Hoax!  \n\nThis 4 hour presentation is part 2 of the Corporation Nation series. While a shorter, condensed version will be released soon, The Great Pension Fund Hoax is presented as documentary evidence of corruption and greed within our government and as a reference work.\n\nThis is not for entertainment.\n\nUnderstanding this information about the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) system of accounting in government will answer the question that has eluded you for so long, just as it did me...\n\nWhy?\n\nWhy do corporations get away with murder?  Why does government allow this to happen by passing laws and regulations, and deregulating the very framework that these corporations operate within, both nationally and internationally?  Why are We, the People suffering at the hands of this oligarchical government, while our taxpayer dollars are being used against us?  And why does there seem to be no difference between the private sector and the public one?\n\nAnswer: Because government the owns it all!!!\n\n\nPBS Now - Prisons For Profit 2008:\nCorporations are running many Americans prisons, but will they put profits before prisoners?  A grim new statistic: One in every hundred Americans is now locked behind bars. As the prison population grows faster than the government can build prisons, private companies see an opportunity for profit.\n\nNOW on PBS investigates the government's trend to outsource prisons and prisoners to the private sector. Critics accuse private prisons of standing in the way of sentencing reform and sacrificing public safety to maximize profits.  &quot;The notion that a corporation making a profit off this practice is more important to us than public safety or the human rights of prisoners is outrageous,&quot; Judy Greene, a criminal policy analyst, tells NOW on PBS.  Companies like Corrections Corporation of America say they're doing their part to solve the problem of inmate overflow and a shortage of beds without sacrificing safety.\n\n\nDeath For Profit  2011:\nRoberto Martinez-Medina died in CCA's Stewart Detention Center in Georgia in 2009. Medina had been arrested a month earlier for not having a driver's license.  CCA whistle-blower Brian Holcomb spoke with us exclusively to expose how the company repeatedly ignored Medina's pleas for care of his heart ailment while he was imprisoned. Their negligence contributed to Medina's death.\n\nCCA profited off of Medina's incarceration, and ensured a greater profit by denying him critical health care. The inhumane conditions at CCA facilities are directly related to their obsession in cutting costs for profit.\nCCA has gone to great lengths to hush Medina's death.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://mycuentame.org/immigrantsforsale/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://mycuentame.org/immigrantsforsale/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nThe Enemy Within - A Global Conspiracy:\nSince our nationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s inception in 1776 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ cold, cunning conspirators have sought to undermine our political sovereignty for their own personal profit.  Behind a facade of corporate and congressional respectability, a cabal of ruthless men use extortion and murder to steal our nationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s wealth and turn the United States into a fascist war-machine that inexorably threatens the entire world. But now at last, the American people are rising to unmask.\nThis is in memory of my Mom who passed at 11:44 pm PST ON 1-25-2011. Now she knows.\n\nThese Torrents are currently on a Free Leech --  High Speed Server\n\nJESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.\n\nBorn of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\nRAPtURE (My transportation outta here).\n\nThe Blessed Hope.  If you believe in The Rapture you better believe The Above Statement and that the Sacrificed Blood of Jesus, on the Cross paid for your sins and there is NOTHING Else you can do to gain Salvation, The GRACE of Christ did it ALL. Now you just have to believe that with all your Heart, Mind and Soul or Maybe Get Left Behind. All PAST, Present and Future Sins are Forgiven with Jesus. (I wouldn't PUSH That Future sin statement to much!!!)\n\nIn a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed...\n\n&quot;And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.\n\n&quot;Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,  Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in The Air, and there we will be forever be with him...hmmm sounds like some of us might be Immortal. (Ask your preacher about that)\n\nMore Torrents in this series atALL TORRENTS are RELEASED here FIRST!!! The First down loaders of my torrents get the Main Hookups on my SERVER.
