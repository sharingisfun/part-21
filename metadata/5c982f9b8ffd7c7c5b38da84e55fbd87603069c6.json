In the Montana of the late 19th century, wounded outlaw Johnny Gault (Tim Daly) is given refuge by widowed sheep farmer Rebecca Yoder (Naomi Watts). This puts Rebecca on the outs with her own people, a pacifist Quaker sect, and also incurs the wrath of a ruthless cattle baron, who has long coveted the Quakers' land--and who also was responsible for the death of Rebecca's husband. Not surprisingly, Johnny Gault turns out to be the traditional &quot;good bad man&quot;, capable of solving everyone's problems--except, perhaps, his own. The Outsider first aired over the Showtime cable network on November 10, 2002.\n\nAlso known as: O Forasteiro, The Outsider - Nach eigenen Regeln, El forastero, Un mystÃƒÂ©rieux ÃƒÂ©tranger, Kirekesztve, Ãï¿½Ã‘Æ’Ã‘â€šÃ‘ï¿½ÃÂ°ÃÂ¹ÃÂ´ÃÂµÃ‘â‚¬.\nCountry: USA\nStudio: Coote Hayes Productions, Hallmark Entertainment, Phoenix Pictures, Showtime Networks, DEJ Productions, Umbrella Entertainment.\nDuration: 1:53:51\n\nFile\nCodec: MPEG2\nQuality: DVD9\nVideo: 720x576, PAL, 25 fps, 4:3\nAudio #1: Russian (Dolby AC3, 6 ch, 448 Kbps) ÃÅ¸Ã‘â‚¬ÃÂ¾Ã‘â€žÃÂµÃ‘ï¿½Ã‘ï¿½ÃÂ¸ÃÂ¾ÃÂ½ÃÂ°ÃÂ»Ã‘Å’ÃÂ½Ã‘â€¹ÃÂ¹ (ÃÂ´Ã‘Æ’ÃÂ±ÃÂ»ÃÂ¸Ã‘â‚¬ÃÂ¾ÃÂ²ÃÂ°ÃÂ½ÃÂ½Ã‘â€¹ÃÂ¹)\nAudio #2: English (Dolby AC3, 6 ch, 448 Kbps) ÃÅ¾Ã‘â‚¬ÃÂ¸ÃÂ³ÃÂ¸ÃÂ½ÃÂ°ÃÂ»\nSubtitles #1: Russian","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c982f9b8ffd7c7c5b38da84e55fbd87603069c6","amp;dn":"The+Outsider+2002+DVD+Naomi+Watts%2C+Tim+Daly%2C+David+Carradine","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c982f9b8ffd7c7c5b38da84e55fbd87603069c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,152,47,155,143,253,124,124,91,56,218,132,229,95,189,135,96,48,105,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
