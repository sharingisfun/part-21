There's the girl unravelled by a kiss in Bloodlines; the sweet-sour woman in Trip Trap, described in such fairytale language you wonder if she's a witch; the truculent gang at the heart of The Village, who &quot;don't believe what they have sold us&quot;. The music is shaped by the characters, with rhythm particularly affected: in The Village, percussive clicks and snapping chords power across electronic samples until the rhythm gets trapped in a loop; in Follow Follow and So Far From Here, both depicting village outsiders, guitars, keyboards and vocals are syncopated, creating an atmosphere of slipperiness and shift. It's such a nuanced album that it can feel undemonstrative, with even the choruses lacking impact Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but that, too, typifies a place where nothing is what it first seems.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fad5d34d67cf895fc950cd6ffe7c6ea55b9f9ceb","amp;dn":"Tunng+-+Turbines+%5B2013%5D%5B+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fad5d34d67cf895fc950cd6ffe7c6ea55b9f9ceb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,213,211,77,103,207,137,95,201,80,205,111,254,124,110,165,91,159,156,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
