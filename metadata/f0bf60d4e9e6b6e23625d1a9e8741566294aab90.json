If you were not hidden, it would not exist, or at least not like this.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nWhen SheppardÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s team encounter a culture with phase shift technology that keeps their entire population invisible - and immaterial - to the outside world, it looks like Atlantis might have found the perfect protection from the Wraith. Eager to make a trade for the technology, Doctor Weir embarks on a diplomatic mission to negotiate with the people of Lannavulin. But once there, it becomes apparent that not everyone is happy with the planetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s status quo...\n\nCHRONOLOGICAL PLACEMENT\n\nThis story assumes that Doctor Weir was mind-probed by the Asurans following her capture at the beginning of season four. During the probe, the incident she recalls is set during season three, after Common Ground and prior to First Strike.\n\nFeaturing: Torri Higginson and Timothy Watson\nWriter:\tSharon Gosling\nMusic:\tSteve Foxon\nDirector:\tSharon Gosling \t\nSound Design:\tSteve Foxon\nPost-Production:\tSteve Foxon\t\nRecorded:\t21 January 2008\nDuration:\t70' approx\t\nReleased:\tMay 2008\nCover: \tAlex Mallinson\t\nProduction Code: BFPSGCD02\nNo. of CDs:\t1 \t\nISBN:\t1-84435-345-1 (978-1-84435-345-3)\n\nCD Extras\nBehind-the-scenes interview with Torri Higginson","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0bf60d4e9e6b6e23625d1a9e8741566294aab90","amp;dn":"Stargate+Atlantis%3A+A+Necessary+Evil+%28Big+Finish+1.2%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f0bf60d4e9e6b6e23625d1a9e8741566294aab90","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,191,96,212,233,230,182,226,54,37,209,169,232,116,21,102,41,74,171,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
