However this is not very Handy. Creating playlists take time and come along the month. This month I had a little catching up to do so that did not fit to nicely. So the first eight playlists of November may contain some outdated tracks (but sound awfully well).\n\nTo make it easier I decided to release the lists one by one. The parts have a continuous number to check completeness. @1 in front of the playlist title still means Easy listening, @2 Rocky and @3 Alternative.\n\n\n\nDutch Treat - Indie Playlist 1111-06 - @1 Big Jumps\n\n01 - The Continental Divide (Canoe) \n02 - Fishing For A Dream (Turin Brakes) \n03 - Late Night Radio (David Gray) \n04 - The Cities That You've Burned (Adam Haworth Stephens) \n05 - Toxic Girl (Kings Of Convenience) \n06 - Cracks (Jane Taylor) \n07 - Already Yours (Bahamas) \n08 - Hiding Tonight (Alex Turner) \n09 - Big Jumps (Emiliana Torrini) \n10 - The Ancient Commonsense Of Things (Bishop Allen) \n11 - Apologies (Christie Dupree) \n12 - Are We There Yet (Ingrid Michaelson) \n13 - The Otherside (Breaks Co-Op) \n14 - Chat With Sivan (Foxtails Brigade) \n15 - Busy (Olly Murs) \n16 - Basic Space (The XX) \n17 - Bluebirds (Adam Green) \n18 - Tenere Taqhim Tossam (Jealous Desert) (Tinariwen) \n19 - The Time Of Times (Badly Drawn Boy) \n20 - Bear In A Cave (Rose Melberg) \n21 - Just Like The Rain (Richard Hawley) \n22 - Bruised Ghosts (Amy Millan) \n23 - Champagne Supernova (Oasis) \n\n\nEnjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:378fb4ba203a37fcc19b7e1e655f845325b7ee37","amp;dn":"Indie+Playlists+1111+%2306+-+Big+Jumps+%28Dutch+Treat+HQ+MP3+VBR%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"378fb4ba203a37fcc19b7e1e655f845325b7ee37","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,143,180,186,32,58,55,252,193,155,126,30,101,95,132,83,37,183,238,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
