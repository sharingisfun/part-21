The concert party itself has been marooned by the sudden departure - with the money - of their manager, but in their different ways, this trio are just what the concert party needs. There are ups and downs and the concert party will not necessarily succeed, but the trio will have had their lives enriched by the experience.\n\nThe characters are well rounded and although the story was written over 70 years ago, this adaptation makes it sound fresh and relevant.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2508eb86af425cd1e9c5e2e94c7403c8cc844027","amp;dn":"The+Good+Companions+-+J+B+Priestley","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2508eb86af425cd1e9c5e2e94c7403c8cc844027","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,8,235,134,175,66,92,209,233,197,226,233,76,116,3,200,204,132,64,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
