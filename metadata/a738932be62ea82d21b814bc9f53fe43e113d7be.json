Widely referred to as &quot;The Father of History&quot; (first conferred by Cicero), he was the first historian known to collect his materials systematically and critically, and then to arrange them into a historiographic narrative.[1] The HistoriesÃ¢â‚¬â€his masterpiece and the only work he is known to have producedÃ¢â‚¬â€is a record of his &quot;inquiry&quot; (or Ã¡Â¼Â±ÃÆ’Ãâ€žÃŽÂ¿Ãï¿½ÃŽÂ¯ÃŽÂ± historÃƒÂ­a, a word that passed into Latin and acquired its modern meaning of &quot;history&quot;), being an investigation of the origins of the Greco-Persian Wars and including a wealth of geographical and ethnographical information. Although some of his stories were fanciful and others possibly inaccurate, he claimed he was reporting only what had been told to him.
