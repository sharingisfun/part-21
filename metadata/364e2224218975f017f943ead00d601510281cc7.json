Originally formed in 2006 under the moniker Dodobird as a one man acoustic act, Meric Long would gig around SF playing folky guitar with a combination of loops and ambient keyboards. Having already studied West African Ewe drumming, Meric got turned onto country blues fingerpicking and sought to create a band where the drumming could be a center role and help bring out the syncopated rhythms coming out of the acoustic guitar. Through a chance introduction by a roommate, Meric met Santa Cruz transplant Logan Kroeber, who had also been experimenting with drumming, but in the area of progressive metal.\n\n1\tWalking\n2\tRed &amp; Purple\n3\tEyelids\n4\tFools\n5\tJoe's Waltz\n6\tWinter\n7\tIt's That Time Again\n8\tPaint The Rust\n9\tPark Song\n10\tJody\n11\tAshley\n12\tThe Season\n13\tUndeclared\n14\tGod?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:364e2224218975f017f943ead00d601510281cc7","amp;dn":"The+Dodos+-+Visiter","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"364e2224218975f017f943ead00d601510281cc7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,78,34,36,33,137,117,240,23,249,67,234,208,13,96,21,16,40,28,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
