The film follows the life journey of the eldest son, Jack, through the innocence of childhood to his disillusioned adult years as he tries to reconcile a complicated relationship with his father (Brad Pitt). Jack (played as an adult by Sean Penn) finds himself a lost soul in the modern world, seeking answers to the origins and meaning of life while questioning the existence of faith. Through Malick's signature imagery, we see how both brute nature and spiritual grace shape not only our lives as individuals and families, but all life. -- (C) Fox Searchlight\n\n\nPG-13, 2 hr. 18 min.\n\nDrama, Action &amp; Adventure, Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy\n\nDirected By:Terrence Malick\n\n\nIn Theaters: May 27, 2011 Limited\n\nOn DVD: Oct 11, 2011\n\nUS Box Office:$13.2M\n\nFox Searchlight\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6cb59a9ae57c8a5f301eb8e21e5130946ac4d90","amp;dn":"The+Tree+of+Life+2011+DVDRip+XviD+With+Greek+Sub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6cb59a9ae57c8a5f301eb8e21e5130946ac4d90","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,203,89,169,174,87,200,165,243,1,235,142,33,229,19,9,70,172,77,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
