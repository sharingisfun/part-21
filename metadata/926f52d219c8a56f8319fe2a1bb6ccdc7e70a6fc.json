Players can control their avatar much like their own bodies using the 'Nerve Gear' device. The much anticipated Sword Art Online has just been released, by the creator of the Nerve Gear. On launch day, players discover the log out function is missing and the game creator announces that in order for everyone to escape, the game must be beaten. However, if a player dies in the game or the Nerve Gear is tampered with, they will die for real. One of the beta testers, 'Kirito' begins his climb to the 100th floor to defeat the final boss.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:926f52d219c8a56f8319fe2a1bb6ccdc7e70a6fc","amp;dn":"%5BCoalgirls%5D+Sword+Art+Online+%281920x1080+Blu-ray+FLAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"926f52d219c8a56f8319fe2a1bb6ccdc7e70a6fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,111,82,210,25,200,165,111,131,25,254,42,27,182,204,220,126,112,166,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
