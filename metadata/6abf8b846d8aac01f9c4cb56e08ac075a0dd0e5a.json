The doctor tells him his aches and pains are psychosomatic but he refuses to accept it. Later that night, a Mr. Cadwallader suddenly appears in his room and has a proposition for him: in return for his soul, he will give him immortality. He even has an escape clause in that if he ever gets tired of living, Cadwallader will provide him with a hasty demise. He accepts the deal and soon collects 14 insurance claims over a variety of accidents. He finds it all very boring however but his quest for a thrill brings results with an unexpected outcome.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6abf8b846d8aac01f9c4cb56e08ac075a0dd0e5a","amp;dn":"The+Twilight+Zone+-+Escape+Clause","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6abf8b846d8aac01f9c4cb56e08ac075a0dd0e5a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,191,139,132,109,138,172,1,249,196,203,86,224,138,192,117,160,221,14,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
