Mesa Verde\n\n'Migrations of Glass' is DesertshoreÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fourth record over all and finds them returning to the full instrumental mode of their critically acclaimed debut, Ã¢â‚¬ËœDrifting Your MajestyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢sÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ re-examination of instrumental rock and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s possibilities.\n\nThe two forces behind Desertshore come from quite different directions. Chris Connolly is a classically trained pianist who studied with Julian White and Sharon Mann in California. He is also a biochemist graduating from UC Berkeley. Phil CarneyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s history is from the rock world. He played guitar in San Francisco legends, Red House Painters and later, Sun Kil Moon. This melding of rock and classical, atmosphere and craft, defines Desertshore. Their shared interest in ethereal sounds and the fact that neither was afraid of allowing the music to lead them in whatever harmonic direction seems right, unites them.\n\nSun Kil MoonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Mark Kozelek makes a brief appearance on this new album playing bass on one song.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:55f57f5e9c8041e330f72986d8f8c360526c628c","amp;dn":"Desertshore+-+Migrations+of+Glass+%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"55f57f5e9c8041e330f72986d8f8c360526c628c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,245,127,94,156,128,65,227,48,247,41,134,216,248,195,96,82,108,98,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
