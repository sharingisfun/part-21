Dino is the jock with secret sensitivity; Jonathan is the artist who sees life through a camera lens; and Ben is the &amp;#039;A&amp;#039; student who will never make his parents happy. The three are fast friends, and always talk (and think) about their favorite subject: girls and sex with girls.\n\nThe television series is based on British author Melvin Burgess&amp;#039; controversial novel &quot;Doing It&quot;.\n\nProduced by: Sachs/Judah, Cabloom!, and Touchstone Television\n\nTheme Song: &quot;Sooner or Later&quot; by Michael Tolcher.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:272064226762c9ea10958f0d7a039b3c49964c12","amp;dn":"Life+As+We+Know+It","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"272064226762c9ea10958f0d7a039b3c49964c12","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,32,100,34,103,98,201,234,16,149,143,13,122,3,155,60,73,150,76,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
