Epub and mobi formats.\n\n\n\nSummary from Amazon: After a messy break-up, Allie Jones finds herself living alone in her New York City apartment, no one to share her bed with--and more urgently, no one to share her rent. The solution seems clear: she needs a roommate. And Hedra Carlson seems perfect--she's shy, quiet...safe. But soon Hedra's disturbing envy of Allie's looks and social life becomes unsettling. She wears Allie's clothes, even buys a wig in Allie's color and style. Then the obscene phone calls begin, Allie's credit cards vanish, and she discovers Hedra is living a dangerous double life. . .and far worse. For Hedra's twisted admiration has no limits, the nightmare has just begun, and there will be a bloody price to pay.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d27c4c873f66c5cf56d5be6f9f7525422e8dfeeb","amp;dn":"Single+White+Female+by+John+Lutz+%5Bepub%2C+mobi%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d27c4c873f66c5cf56d5be6f9f7525422e8dfeeb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,124,76,135,63,102,197,207,86,213,190,111,159,117,37,66,46,141,254,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
