AIDA64 Extreme Edition provides a wide range of features to assist in overclocking, hardware error diagnosis, stress testing, and sensor monitoring. It has unique capabilities to assess the performance of the processor, system memory, and disk drives. AIDA64 is compatible with all current 32-bit and 64-bit Microsoft Windows operating systems, including Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012.\n\nCPU, memory and disk benchmarks\n\nAIDA64 implements a set of 64-bit benchmarks to measure how fast the computer performs various data processing tasks and mathematical calculations. Memory and cache benchmarks are available to analyze system RAM bandwidth and latency. Processor benchmarks utilize MMX, 3DNow!, SSE, XOP, FMA, and AVX instructions, and scale up to 32 processor cores. For legacy processors all benchmarks are available in 32-bit version as well. AIDA64 Disk Benchmark determines the data transfer speed of hard disk drives, solid-state drives, optical drives, and flash memory based devices.

Measured values can be displayed on System Tray icons, OSD panel, Sidebar Gadget, and Logitech G15/G19 Gaming Keyboard LCD. The values can also be logged to file or exported to external applications such as RivaTuner or Samurai. AIDA64 can also alarm the user when it detects overheating, over-voltage, or cooling fan failure.\n\nHardware diagnostics\n\nAIDA64 has the most accurate hardware detection capabilities in its class, to provide detailed information on the computer internals without the need to open it up. The hardware detection module is strengthened by an exhaustive hardware database holding over 150,000 entries. Additional modules are available to overview processor frequencies, check CRT and LCD display status, and stress the system to reveal potential hardware failures and thermal issues.\n\nSoftware and operating system analysis\n\nAIDA64 provides over 50 pages of information on installed programs, software licenses, security applications, and Windows settings. List of started processes, services, DLL files, startup programs, and visited web pages is also available.\n\nSupported OS:\n\nAIDA64 is compatible with all current 32-bit and 64-bit Microsoft Windows operating systems, including Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012.\n\nWindows 95/98/Me\nWindows NT4/2000\nWindows XP\nWindows PE\nWindows Server 2003\nWindows Vista\nWindows Server 2008\nWindows 7\nWindows Server 2008 R2\nWindows 8\nWindows Server 2012\n\nHomepage: http://www.aida64.com/ \n\nInstallation Instructions:\n\n- Install program.\n- Register application with given key.\n- Done, Enjoy. \n\nHave A Nice Day\n\nNote: Uploader is only responsible if any problem in torrent, never responsible for software functionality problems.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f40320d5dd465a2644a74ce524debd14ddcf65a","amp;dn":"FinalWire+AIDA64+Extreme+Edition+v2.85.2400+Multilingual+with+Ke","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f40320d5dd465a2644a74ce524debd14ddcf65a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,64,50,13,93,212,101,162,100,74,116,206,82,77,235,209,77,220,246,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
