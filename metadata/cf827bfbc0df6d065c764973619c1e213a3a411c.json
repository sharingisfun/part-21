I have no affiliation with the creator or developers in any way nor did I ask their permission to upload this. This is one person's attempt to help revitalize a dying genre of RPG that I have a personal love for.\n\nPLEASE SUPPORT THIS GAME AND IT'S DEVELOPERS!!!!!!\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n\nFrom the Kickstarter Page:\n\n&quot;Fire Emblem-style tactical RPG with modding, custom campaigns, bridge-building, destructible battlefields, and hotseat multiplayer.&quot;\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“With destructible buildings, bridge construction to create new flanking opportunities and the ability to throw people into lava, it sounds like Telepath Tactics may contain all that is necessary for my tactical needs.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œAdam Smith, Rock Paper Shotgun\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The gameplay recalls SegaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Shining Force series, mixed with a bit of Advance Wars Ã¢â‚¬â€ as a fan of both, I definitely approve of the direction this oneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s taking!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œThe Indie Games Blog\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“You can smash through walls, rob the high ground, build bridges, and lay down explosives. You can also back your foes into undesirable puddles of stuff, like water and lava. For a change, try flinging your best friend off a cliff.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œGameZebo","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf827bfbc0df6d065c764973619c1e213a3a411c","amp;dn":"Telepath+Tactics+Demo+%28Win+Linux+Mac%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf827bfbc0df6d065c764973619c1e213a3a411c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,130,123,251,192,223,109,6,92,118,73,115,97,156,30,33,58,58,65,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
