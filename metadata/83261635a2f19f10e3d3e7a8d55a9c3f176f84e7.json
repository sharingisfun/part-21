Both sides of the Dutch Concrete Jungle single plus both tracks from the free single which accompanied initial copies of More Specials are also included. \r\nThe Bodysnatchers live version of 007 is the only unreleased track in the set, however it did previously appear in the film Dance Craze but failed to make it on to the films soundtrack album.\r\nJerry Dammers was less than impressed with its release and had this to say about it: &quot;It's real train spotters stuff with every B-side from every free single and I wasn't even consulted about it. In some ways that (The Compact 2 Tone Story) is the worst.&quot; (Uncut Magazine interview 1998).\r\nEach of the CDs comes in its own mini 2 Tone sleeve and an A5 version of George Marshalls book The Two Tone Story is also included. (2-tone.info)\r\n\r\n\r\nReview\r\n\r\nI've gotta say this is a great collection of most of the best from The Specials, The Selecter, The Beat, Madness, Bodysnatchers and early Elvis C. The sound is very fine. \r\nEach of the four discs comes in its own sleeve and included in this set is George Marshall's essential 112 page history, &quot;The Two Tone Story&quot;. \r\nThis hard to find set is important and lots of fun.
