Loaded with fresh arrangements and spunky instrumentation, Struttin' Our Stuff is possibly no definitely the best solo release by a Rolling Stone band member. Some of the songs are jazz, others are blues, and there certainly is a dose of rock n roll to satisfy your soul. The guest vocals of Georgie Fame, Beerly Skeete, and others add plenty of depth to this collection. There are a few moments when Bill Wyman gets a vocal and in small doses his stylings are certainly more than passable. Can't Get Enough Of That Stuff and Going Crazy Overnight are CD highlights as Bill's voice works well with the arrangments. Special appearances by Eric Clapton, Max Middleton(Jeff Beck's phenomenal Blow By Blow CD), and Peter Frampton are certainly worth noting. Truthfully it rates between four and five stars but I'm going to round it up to the five because it deserves more notoriety than its been getting.&quot;\n\n&quot;This album is a throwback and tribute to great blues over the past 40 years. Bill Wyman has put a great cast together to drive this music home to the 1990'and hereafter. The music holds together with strong rhythym, powerful vocals and a nice selection. It ain't heavy, but it's a lot of fun, you get the sense that Wyman and friends really enjoyed putting this album together. To paraphrase a line from one of my favorite pieces: Ya gotta get this stuff.&quot; \n\nBrought to you by TQMP.
