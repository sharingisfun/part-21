She charted major hit records in the 1960s and 1970s, working in idioms ranging from early-'60s girl group-style ballads to Jackie Deshannon folk-influenced pop, to adult contemporary pop in the manner of later Dusty Springfield. She also embarked on an acting career, initially in the late 1960s in association with her work as part of Sonny &amp; Cher but later on her own, which led to a series of increasingly polished and compelling performances in Silkwood, Mask and Moonstruck, for which she won the Academy Award for Best Actress. \n\n\n\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tFlac Perfect (Lossless)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\nLabel:1\t\t\tMCA\nCatalog#:\t\t314560209-2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info\n\n\nDisc One\n\n01.The Way Of Love\n02.All I Really Want To Do\n03.Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)\n04.You Better Sit Down Kids\n05.Gypsies, Tramps And Thieves\n06.All I Ever Need Is You (With Sonny Bono)\n07.He'll Never Know\n08.When You Find Out Where You're Goin', Let Me Know\n09.I Hate To Sleep Alone\n10.Touch And Go\n11.Living In A House Divided\n12.It Might As Well Stay Monday (From Now On)\n13.Song For You\n14.When You Say Love (With Sonny Bono)\n15.Don't Ever Try To Close A Rose\n16.Don't Hide Your Love\n17.How Can You Mend A Broken Heart\n18.Two People Clinging To A Thread\n19.Don't Put It On Me\n20.Classified 1A\n\n\nDisc Two\n\n01.Half-Breed\n02.A Cowboy's Work Is Never Done (With Sonny Bono)\n03.Never Been To Spain\n04.My Love\n05.The Greatest Song I Ever Heard\n06.Carousel Man\n07.David's Song\n08.Melody\n09.Chastity Sun (AKA Ruby Jean And Billie Lee)\n10.Dark Lady\n11.Train Of Thought\n12.I Saw A Man And He Danced With His Wife\n13.Make The Man Love Me\n14.Dixie Girl\n15.I Got It Bad (And That Ain't Good)\n16.Am I Blue\n17.What'll I Do\n18.The Beat Goes On (With Sonny Bono)\n19.I Got You Babe (With Sonny Bono)\n20.Take Me Home\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n\n                   ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7976abf007b5f9d0cf69b948438c7a2ad49dee25","amp;dn":"Cher+-+The+Way+Of+Love%3A+The+Cher+Collection+%282000%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7976abf007b5f9d0cf69b948438c7a2ad49dee25","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,118,171,240,7,181,249,208,207,105,185,72,67,140,122,42,212,157,238,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
