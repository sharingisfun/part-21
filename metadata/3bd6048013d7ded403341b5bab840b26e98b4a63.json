Good People\n\nIntroducing DS Glyn Capaldi, half Welsh, half-Italian, all maverick. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fallen from grace in Cardiff and exiled to be the catch-all detective in the big bit in the middle that God gave to the sheep. A place where nothing of any significance is meant to happen, a place where supposedly he can do little harm.\n\nBut trouble have a way of catching-up with Capaldi. Six men and a young woman disappear into the night. They donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t all reappear. The ones that do are good people with a good explanation. Only Capaldi remains unconvinced.\n\nIn the face of opposition from the locals, he delves deeper and starts to uncover a network of conflicts, betrayals and depravity that resonates below the outwardly calm surface of rural respectability. D.S. Capaldi is back in the saddle.\n\n2. Dead People\n\nDS Glyn Capaldi, half Welsh, half Italian, all maverick, returns in the CWA shortlisted series blowing fresh life into crime fiction\n\nDS Glyn Capaldi, exiled to the big empty middle of Wales to atone for past sins in Cardiff, is called in to investigate a human skeleton that has been uncovered during the excavations for a wind farm in a remote valley. The body is missing its head and its hands. Identity erasure or a ritual killing? GlynÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s assertion that there must be a local connection is overruled by his superiors, They believe that the body has been transported and dumped, a theory that gains support when additional bodies start to pile up. But Capaldi is unconvinced, and sets out to prove that there is someone within the local community capable of achieving the levels of cold and manipulative brutality that have been demonstrated.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3bd6048013d7ded403341b5bab840b26e98b4a63","amp;dn":"Ewart+Hutton+-+DS+Glyn+Capaldi+series+%28Retail%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3bd6048013d7ded403341b5bab840b26e98b4a63","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,214,4,128,19,215,222,212,3,52,27,91,171,132,11,38,233,139,74,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
