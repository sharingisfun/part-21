From a detailed examination of the individual components of an ancient army and their equip-ment, to a fascinating exploration of ancient battle strategies, siege warfare, and naval battles, the book explores the unique tactics required to win battles with the technology available. Featuring specially commissioned color and black-and-white artwork and twenty-four full-color tactical maps, this book shows in great detail the methods by which armies, including Assyrians and Roman forces, prevailed over their foes, and why other armies were less successful. This is a must-read for anyone interested in ancient warfare. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4708215467174842f9150f91ebeeada1912281f5","amp;dn":"Fighting+Techniques+of+the+Ancient+World","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4708215467174842f9150f91ebeeada1912281f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,8,33,84,103,23,72,66,249,21,15,145,235,238,173,161,145,34,129,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
