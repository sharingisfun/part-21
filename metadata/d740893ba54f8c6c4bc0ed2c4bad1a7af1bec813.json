CD with 16-page booklet.\n\nOUT OF A HONKYTONK contains tracks recorded for MGM from 1956 to 1959. Bob Gallion never really made much of an impression on the country charts or on country history, but as Bear Family's 2000 compilation Out of a Honky Tonk proves, he didn't deserve to be ignored. He didn't really have any song that stood out from the pack -- perhaps that's the reason why he couldn't score a real hit while he was recording for MGM in the late '60s -- but he was a solid performer with a strong voice in the best honky tonk tradition. His 1956 single &quot;Hey, Mr. Bartender&quot; is an overlooked barroom gem that's ripe for revival, and there are several other songs -- &quot;Out of a Honky Tonk,&quot; &quot;Your Wild Life's Gonna Get You Down,&quot; &quot;You Gotta Have a Heartbreak (To Know How to Love)&quot; -- that are excellent, straight-ahead country in the vein of Hank Williams. Out of a Honky Tonk is augmented by a number of previously unreleased songs -- a total of five -- making this a complete overview of his waxings for MGM. This isn't necessarily revelatory material -- Gallion wasn't a lost major talent, just a singer who was, at his best, nearly excellent and at his worst, quite enjoyable -- but for anyone enamored of hardcore late-'50s country, this is a terrific listen.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d740893ba54f8c6c4bc0ed2c4bad1a7af1bec813","amp;dn":"Bob+Gallion+-+Out+Of+A+Honky+Tonk+-+Bear+Family+CD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d740893ba54f8c6c4bc0ed2c4bad1a7af1bec813","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,64,137,59,165,79,140,108,75,192,237,44,75,173,26,122,241,190,200,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
