The guitar is the main instrument; saxophones and other wind instruments are gone. There are still those spacey dub clouds. All tunes except the title track are vocal songs. This time, Me'Shell clearly focuses on song. The Post-Rock style (sudden loudness) of the opener Slaughter is no direct indicator of the path this album takes. There's a certain stress on New Wave codes from the 80s on the fast tracks, though, and Me'Shell spices her trademark slow jams with a Post-Rock attitude. Upbeat songs alternate with dreamy yet powerful slow tracks, which are still, in my opinion, Me'Shell's ace. \n\nThis is Me'Shell NdegÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©Ocello at her most accessible. Fortunately, this doesn't mean she lost her idiosyncratic identity. \n\nFavorite tracks: Tie One On; White Girl; Love You Down; Devil's Halo; Die Young; Crying in Your Beer\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1591a0c542c856f97fa406735e2f9fc2e72f273","amp;dn":"Me%5C%27Shell+Ndeg%C3%83%C2%A9ocello...Devil%5C%27s+Halo%282009%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1591a0c542c856f97fa406735e2f9fc2e72f273","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,89,26,12,84,44,133,111,151,250,64,103,53,226,249,252,46,114,242,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
