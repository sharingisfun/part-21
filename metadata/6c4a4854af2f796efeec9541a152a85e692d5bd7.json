The band has always eschewed the modern contrivances of digital music-making, opting for vintage guitars, a trap kit, and tube amps to lay down their synthesis of Americana and British invasion fuzz. The grainy film stock is the perfect visual complement to the peals of feedback and strong-armed beats the band delivers in 26 tunes that keep the audience bouncing. Highlights include a cover of Dolly Parton&amp;#039;s &quot;Jolene,&quot; Leadbelly&amp;#039;s &quot;De Ballit of de Boll Weevil,&quot; and the band&amp;#039;s own &quot;Ball and Biscuit&quot; and &quot;Seven Nation Army.&quot; Fans who cherish the songs in this set on CD (or, better yet, vinyl) are in for a treat as every number is reinterpreted, with Jack White mining for new licks and singing like he&amp;#039;s imbibing on a secret stash of Howlin&amp;#039; Wolf&amp;#039;s moonshine. Meg, stomping her bass drum barefoot, has never looked or sounded as confident behind her kit, especially when she plays whole songs--literally, folks--with one hand behind her back. The disc contains no extras to speak of, just wall-to-wall rock, but true disciples of the Stripes won&amp;#039;t leave disappointed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c4a4854af2f796efeec9541a152a85e692d5bd7","amp;dn":"The+White+Stripes+-+Under+Blackpool+Lights","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c4a4854af2f796efeec9541a152a85e692d5bd7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,74,72,84,175,47,121,110,254,236,149,65,161,82,168,94,105,45,91,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
