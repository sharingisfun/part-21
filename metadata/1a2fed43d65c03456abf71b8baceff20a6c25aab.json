He was charged with murdering his wife, but the lack of direct evidence created a problem for the prosecutor. Indeed, it seemed almost the perfect murder. Things were going so well for Pete Duffy, the defendant, that he was almost confident of acquittal. The protagonist is the last chance for the prosecution to salvage their case and get the conviction.\n\nTheodore Boone grew up an only child with two lawyers as parents. The husband and wife team make up the firm of Boone &amp; Poone and have raised Theodore, who is extremely law savvy and good with people, and who knows most of the legal sector in the town. He is on speaking-terms with the criminal judge and has a reputation amongst his classmates for solving day-to-day legal problems, like rescuing a dog from the pound via Animal Court.\n\nThe Abduction: Theodore Boone is back in a new adventure, and the stakes are even higher. When his best friend, April Finnemore, disappears from her bedroom in the middle of the night, no one, not even TheoÃ¢â‚¬â€who knows April better than anyoneÃ¢â‚¬â€has answers. As fear ripples through his small hometown and the police hit dead ends, it's up to Theo to use his legal knowledge and investigative skills to chase down the truth and save April.\n\nThe Accused: Theodore has been accused of stealing computer equipment from his school when it is found in his locker. Now Theodore must find out who has it out for him all the way keeping the police at bay.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a2fed43d65c03456abf71b8baceff20a6c25aab","amp;dn":"Theodore+Boone+Novels+by+John+Grisham+%28ePub+and+Mobi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a2fed43d65c03456abf71b8baceff20a6c25aab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,47,237,67,214,92,3,69,106,191,113,184,186,206,255,32,166,194,90,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
