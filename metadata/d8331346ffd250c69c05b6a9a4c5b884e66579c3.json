Using Lancelot 'Capability' Brown's first commission - Croome Court in Worcestershire - as his base, Monty sets out to investigate what inspired and influenced this gardening revolution. Along the way, he visits the landscape garden of Rousham, designed by the maverick William Kent, and Stanage Park, designed by the marketing genius Humphrey Repton. Monty discovers how these great landscapes were created, from revealing the Georgian clay recipe that revolutionised garden sculpture to discovering the secrets of mowing with a scythe. He also sees how the present Duke of Devonshire is cutting down trees to restore his park to its 18th-century design.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/2e/The-Secret-History-of-the-British-Garden-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/78/The-Secret-History-of-the-British-Garden-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/1e/The-Secret-History-of-the-British-Garden-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c7/The-Secret-History-of-the-British-Garden-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/8d/The-Secret-History-of-the-British-Garden-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/0c/The-Secret-History-of-the-British-Garden-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/24/The-Secret-History-of-the-British-Garden-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/ff/The-Secret-History-of-the-British-Garden-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/6f/The-Secret-History-of-the-British-Garden-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/57/The-Secret-History-of-the-British-Garden-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/61/The-Secret-History-of-the-British-Garden-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/29/The-Secret-History-of-the-British-Garden-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a4/The-Secret-History-of-the-British-Garden-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/4d/The-Secret-History-of-the-British-Garden-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c4/The-Secret-History-of-the-British-Garden-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/69/The-Secret-History-of-the-British-Garden-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 2992 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 59mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 4\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 1.29 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\nRelease Notes\r\nMerged English Subtitles\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06q5gd0","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8331346ffd250c69c05b6a9a4c5b884e66579c3","amp;dn":"BBC+The+Secret+History+Of+The+British+Garden+2of4+18th+Century+7","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8331346ffd250c69c05b6a9a4c5b884e66579c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,51,19,70,255,210,80,198,156,5,182,169,164,197,184,132,230,101,121,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
