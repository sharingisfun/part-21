The first release on the\nlabel, Stop &amp; Listen Volume 1, was\ncompiled by Dr Bob Jones, the venerable\nUK selector who was for many years an\nintegral part of Southport's core of\nresident DJs who helped shape the sound\nof the Weekender scene.\nOver the past ten years, the label has\ncontinued to release multi-genre\ncompilations, mixed with some killer\nartist contributions while still\nfinding time to introduce authoritative\nnew collections such as 'The Kings OfÃƒÂ '\nseries, always working with veterans\nand newcomers of the finest stripe.\nIt's amongst this musical royalty that\nthe history of the label and the\nlongest running indoor dance and urban\nmusic event in the world continue to\nconverge: an incredible number of\nSouthport Weekender guest artists have\nbeen showcased on the label, Jill\nScott, Roy Ayers, Jazzy Jeff, David\nRodigan and Kenny Dope amongst them.\nWith this in mind, we're most proud to\nannounce a joint venture, building upon\nthis symbiotic relationship with an\nanticipated run of joint projects from\nthese two groundbreaking brands: real\nmusic for real people from the world's\nfriendliest party!\nFirst up is LeFtO whom Fact!
