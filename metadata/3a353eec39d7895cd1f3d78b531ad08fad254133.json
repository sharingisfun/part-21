But it's when his press conference is over that the trouble really starts. The athletic tiger and his boyfriend Lee, a fox with a tongue as quick as his wit, still won't get many breaks in their fight for understanding. They'll need to deal with a stubborn reporter determined to get a story any way he can, furious parents, and hostile teammates--not to mention each other.\n\nAll's fair in love and war--and this is both.\n\nIsolation Play is the eagerly awaited sequel to the best-selling novel Out of Position and picks up Dev and Lee's story about five minutes after the end of the first book. Well over a year and a half in the making, Isolation Play is the longest work Kyell Gold has released.\n\nWarning: contains sexually explicit scenes. Not for underage readers.\n\nPublisher: Sofawolf Press \nLanguage: English\nISBN 978-1-936689-00-2","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a353eec39d7895cd1f3d78b531ad08fad254133","amp;dn":"+Kyell+Gold+-+Isolation+Play+%5BAdult+Gay+Furry%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a353eec39d7895cd1f3d78b531ad08fad254133","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,53,62,236,57,215,137,92,209,243,215,139,83,26,208,143,173,37,65,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
