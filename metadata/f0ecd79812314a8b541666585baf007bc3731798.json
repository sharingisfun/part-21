He sets the stage for a\nlife force panorama, iterated through the power of music that casts a dour or\nominous state of affairs. Recorded in Norway, the Scandinavian trio exercises\nsome bloodletting here.\n\nThe injustices of society in general are transmitted via KÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¿chen's often\ngut-wrenching baritone and alto sax phrasings, topped off with a nicely\narticulated gruff tone and fluent craftsmanship that's supported by the rhythm\nsection's blustery mode of execution, which assists with the saxophonist's\nangst-driven tone poems. With frenetic abandon and yearning lines, KÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¿chen's\nhyper-expressionism could make Albert Ayler sound like a purveyor of children's\nlullabies, as the band embarks upon a whirlwind course of action, sans a few\ntemperate moments.\n\nThe trio goes on a search and conquer mission during &quot;Strid Comes,&quot; letting it\nall hang out. The group exorcises the demons here and during other works, while\nparalleling the heady subject matter. At times, it appears that Trespass Trio is\ncommunicating doom and gloom or something akin to a Faustian bargain, but in\neffect the musicians simply rev it all up and move forward with an underlying\ntheme, seemingly structured on a chaotic premise. Conjuring up an aggressive\nstance set forth by a brutish modus operandi, there is the occasional contrast\nwith minimalist-like detours along the way.\n\n--\n\nBy Stef\n\nBy Tim Niland\n\nPor Roberto Barahona (es) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.purojazz.com/2010/03/trespass-trio-y-el-cd-%E2%80%A6-was-there-to-illuminate-the-night-sky-en-purofreejazz/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.purojazz.com/2010/03/trespass-trio-y-el-cd-%E2%80%A6-was-there-to-illuminate-the-night-sky-en-purofreejazz/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0ecd79812314a8b541666585baf007bc3731798","amp;dn":"Trespass+Trio+-+...Was+T+Illuminate+The+Night+Sky...+%282009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f0ecd79812314a8b541666585baf007bc3731798","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,236,215,152,18,49,74,139,84,22,102,88,91,175,0,123,195,115,23,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
