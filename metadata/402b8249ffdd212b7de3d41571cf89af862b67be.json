Dennis Sustare, Scott Robinson\n(c)1976\n\nBunnies and Burrows is a multi-player game in which each player may explore the possibilities, both hazardous and entertaining, of developing the character whose behaviour they are controlling in the game. What sets this game apart of the multi-player fantasy games that have been achieving such popularity in recent years is that the character each player is running is not a person, but a rabbit. A currently popular novel has demonstrated that rabbits are suitable subjects for fantasy games, while the biological approach brings a freshness to the style of game now dominated by Sword and Sorcery orientation.\n\n-1976 Bunnies and Burrows","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:402b8249ffdd212b7de3d41571cf89af862b67be","amp;dn":"Bunnies+%26amp%3B+Burrows","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"402b8249ffdd212b7de3d41571cf89af862b67be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,43,130,73,255,221,33,43,125,227,212,21,113,207,137,175,134,43,103,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
