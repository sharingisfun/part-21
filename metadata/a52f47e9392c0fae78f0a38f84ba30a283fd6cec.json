His particular interest is in treating patients with a acute mania, which he describes is caused by the male child's longing for the unconditional love he gets from his mother, and after he separates from her, he searches for this love in other women, until he meets the one who he feels is capable of offering the same. But when that does not happen, the male child becomes cynical, full of hatred, and distrust and develops acute mania. His hospital nurse, Radha, had successfully treated one such patient by the name of Dev, and now they have another one by the name of Arun Choudhury. A reluctant Radha is asked to act as his caring mother-like nurse, to gain his trust, love him, and then make him ready to face everyday life. What Colonel Saab, Dev, and Arun do not realize what this is doing to Radha herself when she feels that she cannot act anymore and becomes more and more involved in her patients' lives, knowing fully well that she has to keep up a professional attitude, and that the patient is going to be discharged soon, and may not even remember the care, love and treatment he received from Radha. Radha has now to decide to carry on being a nurse, without being a woman, who is quite capable in falling in love with Dev, and again with Arun.\n\n\nREVIEW\nMagnificent ! The Best of Indian Cinema, 28 December 2004\n\nAuthor: darksideofmoon from London, England\n\nThis film is simply mesmerising. I don't think Indian cinema has ever got better then this. Its one of the best Indian films which doesn't play with your sensibilities like the other Bollywood crap. The story, the acting, the background score, the music..its simply brilliant. Every time that song *tum pukaar lo* plays i can feel a shiver down my spine. Check out the scene where Waheeda is standing holding the book and her saree suddenly flows with wind and this song starts in the background...damn good. \n\nIts a pity that not many people know about this film. It should be shown to all the present day filmmakers in India including Chopras and Johars who just take you for a ride. The soundtrack of this film is even better and Gulzar has proved again with *humne dekhi hai un aankhon Ki* song that he is a genius. I assure you the last scene with Waheeda rehman will leave a lump in your throat. After watching this movie u cant do anything but just sit back and admire this brilliant piece of work and you think that Why the hell they don't make such movies anymore?\n\n\nTECH SPECS\nSource.......[ NTSC R1 DVD9   ]      Video Codec...[ XviD 1.2 SMP    ]\nVideo Bitrate.[ 718 kbps        ] Audio Info....[ 123kbps VBR MP3 ]\nRuntime......[ 01:54:29       ]      Language .....[ Hindi           ]\nResolution...[ 576 x 416      ]      Subtitles.....[ English         ]\nFramerate....[ 25.000 fps     ]      Container.....[ AVI             ]\nCD Size.....[ 49x15 = 699.29 ]  \n\n\nALL THANKS TO &quot;BOLLYWOOD RELEASE GROUP aka BrG&quot;\n\n\nSCREENSHOTS\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i585.photobucket.com/albums/ss292/theoneleggedrooster/vlcsnap-2009-11-02-01h49m30s88.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i585.photobucket.com/albums/ss292/theoneleggedrooster/vlcsnap-2009-11-02-01h49m30s88.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i585.photobucket.com/albums/ss292/theoneleggedrooster/vlcsnap-2009-11-02-01h48m11s94.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i585.photobucket.com/albums/ss292/theoneleggedrooster/vlcsnap-2009-11-02-01h48m11s94.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i585.photobucket.com/albums/ss292/theoneleggedrooster/vlcsnap-2009-11-02-01h47m27s128.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i585.photobucket.com/albums/ss292/theoneleggedrooster/vlcsnap-2009-11-02-01h47m27s128.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n********************************* FREAKYFLICKS **********************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing\ncinematic art in the digital era.
