Since then Sol Invictus has had many musician contributions, including Sarah Bradshaw, Nick Hall, CÃƒÂ©line Marleix-Bardeau , Nathalie Van Keymeulen, Ian Read and Karl Blake.\nWakeford repeatedly referred to his work as folk noir. Beginning with a mixture of a rough, bleak, primitive post punk sound and acoustic/folk elements, the band's music gradually evolved toward a lush, refined style, picking up classically-trained players such as Eric Roger, Matt Howden, and Sally Doherty. In the mid-1990s, Sol Invictus spun off a side project called L'Orchestre Noir (later changed to Orchestra Noir) to explore an even more classically influenced direction. 2005 saw the departure of longtime contributors Roger and Blake, leading to a new line-up including Caroline Jago, Lesley Malone and Andrew King.\nIn 1990, Wakeford formed his own label, Tursa, to release his material and the music of other artists. The World Serpent Distribution Company previously distributed this material worldwide, followed then by Cold Spring Records. In July 2007, the label was re-launched as a partnership with Israeli producer and musician Reeve &quot;M&quot; Malka. In 2009, Sol Invictus signed to Prophecy Records. In June 2011, Sol Invictus announced the end of their partnership both with Cold Spring Records and musician Andrew King.\n\nImagery and content\n\nThe name Sol Invictus, which is Latin for 'the unconquered Sun', derives from the Roman cult of the same name.\nThe band's imagery and lyrical content, in its early days, was influenced by traditionalism and antipathy towards the modern world and materialism. A superficial interest was the Italian philosopher Julius Evola who Wakeford admits to &quot;shamelessly stealing from&quot; for song titles even though he found his books &quot;unreadable&quot;. A more serious influence was the poet Ezra Pound: &quot;I think Pound is one of the greatest poets ever, although some of his work is mind-numbingly obscure. I disagree with his antisemitism but that should not blind people to his worth as an artist.&quot;\nThe band also had considerable interest in heathen and Mithraist themes, often reflecting an explicit antipathy to Christianity: the 1997 album The Blade incorporates an Odinic chant, Gealdor, into its varied laments. Wakeford tended to write from a melancholic position of doomed Romanticism, which lamented the loss of beauty, love, and culture. He saw the American influence on global culture as very damaging to Europe, something he expresses with black humour in the song &quot;Death of the West&quot;, from the album of the same name. The later albums have seen a turn to a more personal writing style, as interest in what Wakeford calls &quot;knee-jerk anti-Americanism and anti-Christianity&quot; has been rejected.[citation needed]\nSol Invictus album artwork has often showcased the expressionist paintings of American artist, musician and friend Tor Lundvall.\nSource:Wikipedia\n\n\nCountry: England\nGenre: Dark Folk / Neofolk\nQuality: 320 kbps\nAlbum List:\n\n1.Albums\n\n(1988) Sol Invictus - Against The Modern World [CD reissue 2011]\n(1988) Sol Invictus - Against The Modern World [Mini-EP]\n(1989) Sol Invictus - Lex Talionis [CD reissue 2008]\n(1990) Sol Invictus - Sol Veritas Lux\n(1990) Sol Invictus - Trees In Winter [CD reissue 2011]\n(1991) Sol Invictus - The Killing Tide\n(1992) Sol Invictus - King &amp; Queen\n(1994) Sol Invictus - The Death Of The West\n(1995) Sol Invictus - In The Rain [CD reissue 2007]\n(1997) Sol Invictus - The Blade\n(1999) Sol Invictus - In A Garden Green\n(2000) Sol Invictus - The Hill Of Crosses\n(2002) Sol Invictus - Thrones\n(2005) Sol Invictus - The Devil's Steed\n(2006) Sol Invictus - A Mythological Prospect Of The Citie Of Londinium (with Rose Rowine E Amanti and Andrew King)\n(2011) Sol Invictus - The Cruellest Month\n\n2.Compilations\n\n(1998) Sol Invictus - All Things Strange And Rare\n(2004) Sol Invictus - The Angel\n\n3.Live\n\n(1992) Sol Invictus - Frankfurt Sound Depot 24-03-1991 [with Death In June &amp; Current 93 CD bootleg]\n(1992) Sol Invictus - Let Us Prey\n(1994) Sol Invictus - Black Europe (official bootleg) (CD)\n(1998) Sol Invictus - In Europa [live with Tony Wakeford &amp; L'Orchestre Noir]\n(2000) Sol Invictus - Trieste\n(2001) Sol Invictus - Brugge\n\n5.Singles &amp; EPs\n\n(2000) Sol Invictus - Eve (7'' vinyl single)\n(2004) Sol Invictus - Writ In Water (Sol Invictus, Hawthorn &amp; Sieben CD EP split)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:933d9f9ef7db2f04073fc36f591d1c8369a4d3c9","amp;dn":"Sol+Iinvictus+Discography+%5B16+studio+albums%2C+2+compilation+album","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"933d9f9ef7db2f04073fc36f591d1c8369a4d3c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,61,159,158,247,219,47,4,7,63,195,111,89,29,28,131,105,164,211,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
