Famous cases are followed closely around the world, from the first stages of investigation through to the final sentencing, and the most notorious criminals now gain an unprecedented level of infamy. In True Crime, we investigate some of the most iconic crimes in recent history, from O. J. Simpsonâ€™s â€˜Trial of the Centuryâ€™, to the monstrous actions of Harold Shipman and Josef Fritzl. You can trace the history of New York Stateâ€™s notorious electric chair, Old Sparky, which executed over 300 criminals in Sing Sing prison. Follow the development of the modern criminal from the roots laid down by their 19th-century equivalents, and discover how these cases were solved â€“ if indeed they ever were. Featuring a host of genuine evidence, including oifcial police documentation and unbelievable images, True Crime gives you an insight into the minds of some of historyâ€™s most infamous killers.\r\n\r\nTrue Crime, 2nd Edition\r\nEnglish | PDF | 148 pages | 25.06 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:461c85273b1a926ecbe77b93ae8fe6efab2f153e","amp;dn":"True+Crime%2C+2nd+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"461c85273b1a926ecbe77b93ae8fe6efab2f153e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,28,133,39,59,26,146,110,203,231,123,147,174,143,230,239,171,47,21,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
