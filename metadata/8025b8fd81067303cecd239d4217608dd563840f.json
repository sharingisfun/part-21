Adrienne Barbeau, Maria Ford, Kevin Alber\r\n \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112599/\r\n\r\n\r\nThis soft core exploitation effort from the Roger Corman stable is a peculiar attempt to reinvent Bram Stoker's story as a T &amp; A film featuring marauding babes in rat-pelt bikinis. The story posits an Amazonian group of Victorian-era lesbians who have formed a colony under Queen Adrienne Barbeau. Barbeau is sort of a Pied Piper to a group of vicious rats used in the women's murderous raids on men who have wronged them. In one such attack, the women capture writer Bram Stoker, who is recruited to chronicle the women's activities. But the plot is really secondary here. The main point of this film is to show scantily-clad women running around in bikinis, having sword fights and performing topless veil-dances.\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo: MPEG4 Video (H264), 632x480, 23.976 fps, 1832 Kbps, 01h16m57s\r\nAudio: Dolby AC3, 48000 Hz, stereo, 192 kbps\r\n\r\nDVDRip, English audio, no subtitles\r\n\r\ncover: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/qbmjzex3d/\r\n\r\nscreenshots: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/99za6xjjl/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/twnzs92y9/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/s3l33xhrl/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/jvj5ixpv5/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8025b8fd81067303cecd239d4217608dd563840f","amp;dn":"Burial+of+the+Rats+-+1995+%28Bram+Stoker%2C+Roger+Corman%29+horror","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8025b8fd81067303cecd239d4217608dd563840f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,37,184,253,129,6,115,3,206,205,35,157,66,23,96,141,213,99,132,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
