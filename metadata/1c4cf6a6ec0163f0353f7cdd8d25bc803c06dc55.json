Each episode shifting the focus \nonto a different region as it contrasts the epic power of the \nlandscape with the dramatic struggles of individual creatures \nliving there.\n\nFrom hidden jungles and ice-blue glaciers to erupting volcanoes \nand lakes of poison, Africa explores an astonishing array of \npreviously un-filmed locations and discovers bizarre new \ncreatures and behaviours - including some of the rarest fish \nin the world, exploding insects and lizards that hunt on the \nbacks of lions.\n\nThis landmark five-part series utilises the latest filming \ntechnology to reveal the surprising environments, extraordinary \ncreatures and other fascinating secrets of an amazing continent.\n\n\nNOTE: I suggest downloading VLC Media Player to watch this release.
