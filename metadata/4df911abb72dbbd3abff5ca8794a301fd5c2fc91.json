His thesis was entitled &quot;Music and Song in Persia&quot;. While writing his thesis, he spent 7 years in Tehran as an arts writer for several publications and a PR person for the Center for Preservation and Propagation of Iranian Music.\n\nHe is native in English and fluent in Persian and French. During the 1950s and 60s, Miller played with top jazz artists in Europe like Don Ellis and Eddie Harris.[1] Miller was interested in eastern culture and music. He moved to Iran and mastered Persian music as well as Iranian folk music genres under the supervision of masters Dr. Daryush Safvat and Mahmoud Karimi.\n\nDr. Miller is also known as Kurosh Ali Khan, a name he used while hosting a prime-time television show in Tehran, Iran in the 1970s. The program was known as Kurosh Ali Khan va Dustan, or Kurosh Ali Khan and Friends, a variety show with music.\n\nHis mother, Mrs. Maxine Adams Miller, was the author of Bright Blue Beads: An American Family In Persia,[2] and Dr. Miller is the author of Music and Song in Persia: The Art of Avaz published by Curzon Press London and also by University of Utah Press.\n\nLloyd's recording Oriental Jazz, produced in the 1960s, was re-released recently as a CD and is a current popular item in Europe and the UK and features many selections of jazz and oriental music blends.
