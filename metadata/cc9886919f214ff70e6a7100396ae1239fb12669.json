At the user's fingertips are drum skins, bars, marimbas, plates, strings, and tubes that get sparked into life by a mallet and a flexible noise source.\n\nMix and match\n\nChromaphone combines acoustic resonators to create drums, percussion, string, and synth-like instruments. Membranes, bars, marimbas, plates, strings, and tubes form pairs that get sparked into life by a mallet and a flexible noise source. The resonators' material, tuning, and coupling parameters allow the creation of a wide range of instruments and sonic colors. Whether real, innovative, or with an ethnic touch, Chromaphone will fill your music with rich and organic tones.\n\nMelodies and beats\n\nChromaphone's sound library includes a wide range of expressive and responsive instruments that span from warm and mellow pitched percussions for melodies to punchy one-shots and  kits for rhythm tracks. A wooden bar makes a xylophone, turned metallic it becomes a glockenspiel. Adding a tube transforms it into a vibraphone or marimba. Plates shape up in bells and cymbals. Membranes are used for drum skins, combined with a tube they make bass drums, snares, congas and bongos.\n\nOne-shot revolution\n\nOne-shots are no longer limited to the velocity dimension. Chromaphone uses the entire keyboard range to modulate volume, mallet noise and stiffness, noise filter frequency and density, hit position, and coupling to open a whole world of expressive soundsÃƒÂ³and that in a totally stepless fashion.\n\nCreative drum kits\n\nChromaphone ships with ready-made creative kit patches where each note provides a new sound slightly different from the previous one. Over the entire keyboard range the sound morphs from bass drum to snare to hi-hat.\n\nDiscover a mixture of electronic and acoustic qualities intertwined to form highly playable, addictive, and always fresh drum sounds.\n\nTogether ensemble\n\nA key feature of Chromaphone is a brand-new coupling technology. The coupling refers to the exchange of acoustic energy which occurs in real life between interacting objects.  Consider a string bridged to a wooden soundboard, both have their own behavior and characteristics, but when assembled  together, they merge into a complex string instrument. In a similar way, a metal bar interacts with the air column from a tube in a vibraphone. Chromaphone is the first and only plug-in to provide control over the coupling of resonators. The result is vivid  instruments with unmatched acoustic precision, sharpness and realism.\n\nNeat features:\n\nReal-time control over any parameters via host automation.\nHost tempo synchronization for effects and modulations.\nRelaxed editing with unlimited undo/redo capability.\nNative 64-bit Audio Units (AU) VST plug-ins and AAX plug-ins.\n\n                            \n2) Disconnect from Internet!!! \n                            \n3) Load Plugin and click Authorize \n                            \n4) Copy Serial number from keygen and enter into authorization window \n                            \nNow wait until the &quot;Offline Options&quot; button appears, click it and paste challengecode into keygen then generate response and authorize.\n                            \n5) Have Phun!\n\nnFO bY ThE AiRBEARS 2011\n\n\n\nfuture-dada.com  MMXIV.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc9886919f214ff70e6a7100396ae1239fb12669","amp;dn":"AAS+-+Chromaphone+v1.0.6+-+OS+X+-+TEAM+AiR+%5Bpacket-dada%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc9886919f214ff70e6a7100396ae1239fb12669","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,152,134,145,159,33,79,247,14,106,113,0,57,106,225,35,159,177,38,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
