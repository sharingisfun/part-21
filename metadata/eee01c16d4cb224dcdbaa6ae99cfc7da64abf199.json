Expect mediocre sound quality, some surface noise, and some tape hiss.\n\nThe tracks are:\n\nNothing but the Truth\nBeyond the Pale\nAs Strong as Samson\nThe Idol\nThin End of the Wedge\nMonsieur R. Monde\nFresh Fruit\nButterfly Boys\nNew Lamps for Old\n\nThis is yet another tape from my epic collection of cassettes made with LPs borrowed from the public library, friends and relatives.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eee01c16d4cb224dcdbaa6ae99cfc7da64abf199","amp;dn":"Exotic+Birds+and+Fruit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eee01c16d4cb224dcdbaa6ae99cfc7da64abf199","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,224,28,22,212,203,34,77,205,186,166,174,153,207,199,218,100,171,241,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
