All the major Ellingtonians are present: Cat Anderson, Ray Nance, Jimmy Hamilton, Johnny Hodges, Paul Gonsalves and numerous others. A guest appearance by former Coltrane quartet drummer Elvin Jones comes as an unexpected surprise. This is a far more traditional setting than one would have expected to hear him involved with in 1966. His energy here is infectious and it is worth a listen just to hear him in this context. Although not a typical item in Earl Hines' discography, Ellington fans will certainly love this hard swinging disc.\nTracklist:\n1. Once Upon A Time \n2. Black And Tan Fantasy \n3.
