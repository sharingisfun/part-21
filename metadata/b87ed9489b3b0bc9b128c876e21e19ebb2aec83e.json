In this setting, amidst the opulence and decadence \n                              of Vienna, KLIMT depicts the most productive, and tumultuous, \n                              period of the artist&amp;#039;s life. From his passionate, hedonistic \n                              affair with the notorious French dancer Lea de Castro, to his \n                              battle with an oppressive government for control of his work, \n                              KLIMT, as performed by John Malkovich and directed by award \n                              winning filmmaker Raul Ruiz, is a feverish and sensual homage \n                              to a man who insisted on living his life as he painted it.                                                                     \n                                                                                \n      \n          Film Genre .......: Biography / Drama  \n          IMDb URL .........: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0417871/  \n          IMDB Rating ......: 5.4/10 (406 votes)\n          RT URL ...........: http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/10006828-klimt/\n          RT Av.

Thus, we decided that, from now on, we&amp;#039;ll release some of \n          these to the scene, in case anyone wants them too. We&amp;#039;re not looking for glory or\n          anything like that and You won&amp;#039;t see us releasing CAMs or any &quot;I-wanna-be-first&quot; \n          0-day stuff. We&amp;#039;re just having some old school FUN.\n\n\n          Enjoy! :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b87ed9489b3b0bc9b128c876e21e19ebb2aec83e","amp;dn":"Klimt.2006.DVDRip.XviD-SDN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b87ed9489b3b0bc9b128c876e21e19ebb2aec83e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,126,217,72,155,59,11,201,177,40,200,118,226,30,25,235,178,174,200,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
