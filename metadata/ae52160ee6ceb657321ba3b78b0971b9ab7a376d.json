GOOGLE 'start loving.' Also GOOGLE, 'tracking plan b'  So, I'm working with a 23,400 calorie deficit, and a sleep deficit the last 4 days of near 8 hrs x 4 = 32 hours, so I can get this done, before I am.

This project, on now a 4 day near zero sleep sprint, may be A. one of the wonders of human endurance, or B. full of technical disasters, errors....  I've devoted my life to have it be the former.  If it is the latter, ROFL, I WON'T BE AROUND FOR YOU TO WHINE AT, RIDICULE, BLAME!!!!  FIX IT, BUILD ON IT. DO YOUR PART!  UnviolentPeacemaker\n\n----------------\n\nAlbert Schweitzer\n\nAlbert Schweitzer, OM (14 January 1875 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4 September 1965) was a German and then French theologian, organist, philosopher, physician, and medical missionary. He was born in Kaysersberg in the province of Alsace-Lorraine, at that time part of the German Empire. Schweitzer, a Lutheran, challenged both the secular view of Jesus as depicted by historical-critical methodology current at his time in certain academic circles, as well as the traditional Christian view. He depicted Jesus as one who literally believed the end of the world was coming in his own lifetime and believed himself to be a world savior. He received the 1952 Nobel Peace Prize for his philosophy of &quot;Reverence for Life&quot;, expressed in many ways, but most famously in founding and sustaining the Albert Schweitzer Hospital in LambarÃƒÂ©nÃƒÂ©, now in Gabon, west central Africa (then French Equatorial Africa).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae52160ee6ceb657321ba3b78b0971b9ab7a376d","amp;dn":"Albert+Schweitzer+%5Bmp3%5D+An+Autobiography+-+ScanSoft+Daniel+reads","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae52160ee6ceb657321ba3b78b0971b9ab7a376d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,82,22,14,230,206,182,87,50,27,163,183,139,9,113,185,171,122,55,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
