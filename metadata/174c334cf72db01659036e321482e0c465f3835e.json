With Thanksgiving, you get turkey and all the trimmings. Christmastime brings presents galore. And ValentineÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s DayÃ¢â‚¬â€well, who wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t like to receive 23 valentines? Especially when some of them are sealed with a kiss! With visions of chocolate bunnies and jellybeans dancing in her head, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no wonder why Sister canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t wait for Easter and the Giant Beartown Easter Egg Hunt. Mama Bear worries though. Is the true meaning of Easter getting lost in the hunt? Or will the miracle of spring help Sister Bear find a whole new appreciation for the season? \n\n\nGenre: Childrens","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:174c334cf72db01659036e321482e0c465f3835e","amp;dn":"The+Berenstain+Bears+and+the+Real+Easter+Eggs+-+Stan+%26amp%3B+Jan+B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"174c334cf72db01659036e321482e0c465f3835e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,76,51,76,247,45,176,22,89,3,110,50,20,130,224,196,101,243,131,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
