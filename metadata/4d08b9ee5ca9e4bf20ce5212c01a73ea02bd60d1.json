The Fox Hunt, out of Martinsburg, West Virginia, is that barÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s house band.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ With AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Working the band moves from the midnight dive bar to an afternoon at the county fair with a seamless perfection. Adding to the county fair feel of this album is the fact that this album was recorded live to analog tape with no over dubs or do overs.\n\nThe album features the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s take on 12 traditional Appalachian songs the band grew up listening to in their hometowns in Virgina, West Virginia and Kentucky. As a whole, the album really feels like it could serve as a Volume 2 of the Cold Mountain soundtrack. If, like me, thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s something that sounds good to you, then AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Working So We DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Have To most certainly serves as Essential Listening.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d08b9ee5ca9e4bf20ce5212c01a73ea02bd60d1","amp;dn":"The+Fox+Hunt+-+America%27s+Working+So+We+Don%27t+Have+To+%5B2009%5D%5BEAC%2C","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d08b9ee5ca9e4bf20ce5212c01a73ea02bd60d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,8,185,238,92,169,228,191,32,206,82,18,192,26,115,234,2,189,96,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
