They were one of the very first international artists to tour the huge country - and their fans are still very thankful. So recording a LIVE DVD to highlight the 'Steelhammer' tour was an opportunity the band didn't want to miss. It is the first LIVE release of U.D.O.'s new line-up, which easily convinced fans and critics alike on recent festivals and headlining gigs. The band came up with an exceptional set list, including many classics that hadn't been played for a long time, fan favorites, and tracks from their recent successful album 'Steelhammer'. U.D.O. once again prove why they are hailed as one of the best European live bands.\n\nTracklist:\n\n1.Intro\n2.Steelhammer\n3.King of Mean\n4.Future Land\n5.A Cry of a Nation\n6.Trip to Nowhere\n7.They Want War\n8.Never Cross My Way\n9.Stranger\n10.Stay True\n11.In the Darkness\n12.Azrael\n13.No Limits\n14.Mean Machine\n15.Burning Heat\n16.Metal Machine\n17.Devil's Bite\n18.Go Back to Hell\n19.Timebomb\n20.Holy\n21.Metal Heart (Accept Cover)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5865e0eef10ae6ee03c63179cde6fe232623ed02","amp;dn":"U.D.O.+-+Steelhammer+-+Live+From+Moscow+-+2014+%28DVD5%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5865e0eef10ae6ee03c63179cde6fe232623ed02","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,101,224,238,241,10,230,238,3,198,49,121,205,230,254,35,38,35,237,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
