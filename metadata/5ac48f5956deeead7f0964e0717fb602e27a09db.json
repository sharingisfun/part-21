The episode was broadcasted as a part of the show 'MusikbyrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥n'.\n\nI taped the whole 'MusikbyrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥n' show on VHS, and now I've transferred it to my DVD. The linage is something like National TV -&gt; VHS -&gt; DVD -&gt; XviD.\n\nIntroduction is in Swedish, but the documentary is in English (with Swedish subs).\n\nEnjoy!\n\n/pfb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ac48f5956deeead7f0964e0717fb602e27a09db","amp;dn":"The+Band+-+The+Band","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ac48f5956deeead7f0964e0717fb602e27a09db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,196,143,89,86,222,238,173,127,9,100,224,113,127,182,2,226,122,9,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
