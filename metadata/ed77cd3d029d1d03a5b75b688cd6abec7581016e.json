He introduces us to its extraordinary characters and arcane eccentricities, and tells astonishing stories of courtroom triumph and defeat. Whether heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s defending hapless teenagers at Harlow Youth Court or prosecuting gold bullion robbers at the Old Bailey, these hair-raising tales reveal that justice rarely operates in quite the way we expect. Throughout, McBride grapples with that most important of questions: how do we ensure that the guilty are convicted and the innocent walk free?\n\nUnabridged and read by Paul Ansdell. 8 hours 50 mins duration.
