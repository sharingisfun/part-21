The text includes examples of applications, including photoluminescent nanocomposites, grafted nanomaterials for selective separations of ions or isotopes, for cascade syntheses, chelation of transition metals and lanthanides by lamellar structured nanomaterials, and immobilized enzymes on mesoporous nanomaterials. This indispensable text for graduate students, engineers, and scientists concludes with a look toward future developments","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bbcfe11b398eb87de8cce60bc0fbb626cc260c1a","amp;dn":"Molecular+Chemistry+of+Sol-Gel+Derived+Nanomaterials","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bbcfe11b398eb87de8cce60bc0fbb626cc260c1a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,207,225,27,57,142,184,125,232,204,230,11,192,251,182,38,204,38,12,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
