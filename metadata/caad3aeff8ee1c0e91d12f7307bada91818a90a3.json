Blue Highway turn in an affecting vocal and instrumental performance on guitarist Tim Stafford's haunting &quot;The Rounder,&quot; as well as ripping through a cover of Merle Haggard's &quot;Huntsville&quot; and showcasing their gospel side on a soul-stirring arrangement of the traditional &quot;God Moves in a Windstorm.&quot; Shawn Lane's lonesome tenor is pleasing, as are the harmony blends and the lead vocals of the rest of the band. Ace Dobro player Rob Ickes -- voted 1996 Dobro Player of the Year by the International Bluegrass Music Awards -- shines throughout, rounding out this band's second effort and making it more than a worthwhile choice..","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:caad3aeff8ee1c0e91d12f7307bada91818a90a3","amp;dn":"Blue+Highway+-+Wind+to+the+West+%5B1996%5D%5BLog%2CCue.FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"caad3aeff8ee1c0e91d12f7307bada91818a90a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,173,58,239,248,238,28,14,145,209,47,115,7,186,218,145,129,138,144,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
