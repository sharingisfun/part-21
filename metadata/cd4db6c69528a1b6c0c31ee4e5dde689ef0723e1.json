All of the files I am sharing I own on CD...with a signature by the artist himself.\n\nIf you go to his website you can buy his CD's directly with his signature. How many artists these days go to that trouble! http://www.johngorka.com\n\nAnyway, just sit back and enjoy the music and if you hear what you like, support John by buying his CD's and/or catching him live.\n\n2009.04.06\n\nCompressed using Lame 3.93 @192 from original CD\nCover art embedded\n\n1.
