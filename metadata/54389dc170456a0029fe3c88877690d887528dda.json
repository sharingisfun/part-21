It is part goat, part spider, and its milk can be used to create artificial spider's web.\n\nIt is part of a new field of research, synthetic biology, with a radical aim: to break down nature into spare parts so that we can rebuild it however we please.\n\nThis technology is already being used to make bio-diesel to power cars. Other researchers are looking at how we might, one day, control human emotions by sending 'biological machines' into our brains.\n\n\n\nSource: BBC-HD\n\n\nA/R (WxH): 1:1.78 (720x400)\nVCodec: XviD (2 pass MPEG)\nACodec: AC3 2ch 192Kbps\n\nHD downsized/resized: 1440*1080 to 720*400\n\nFlawless encoding\n\nPls help seed to keep torrent alive!\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54389dc170456a0029fe3c88877690d887528dda","amp;dn":"BBC+Horizon+-+Playing+God+XviD+AC3.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54389dc170456a0029fe3c88877690d887528dda","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,56,157,193,112,69,106,0,41,254,60,136,135,118,144,216,135,82,141,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
