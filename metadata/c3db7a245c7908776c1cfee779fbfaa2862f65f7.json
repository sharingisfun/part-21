I use NERO, and on NERO it is listed under the &quot;burn&quot; tab on the verification screen just before the CD starts burning.\n \nOnce you have the CD, power up your COMAND unit, briefly hold down 1,3,8 at the same time, and the service screen should come up asking you to insert the CD.  Insert the CD and the update will begin automatically. VERY IMPORTANT....DO NOT CHANGE SETTINGS OR TURN IGNITION ON OR OFF DURING THE UPDATE PROCESS.\n\nOnce the CD is done updating, it will eject the CD and the COMAND unit will restart itself.  That&amp;#039;s all there is to it.\n \nMy unit is a 2005 version, and I cannot attest to weather this will work in other versions, but I have read that it will work on all COMAND units.\n\nIf you do not have the Nav module, then this should still update your audio SW... but only if you have the COMAND Head Unit (the one with the large screen).  If you have the smaller unit, I think it&amp;#039;s called the Audio 50 (but don&amp;#039;t quote me on that), then I don&amp;#039;t think this will work for you.\n\nAlso, this IS NOT a map disc.  This is simply the SW update for the COMAND system itself.  This update will add a few features with the Navigation module (i.e., adds the ability to display ETA at the bottom of NAV screen) if you have it installed, but it also updates other audio items as well, like the ability to play MP3 discs.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3db7a245c7908776c1cfee779fbfaa2862f65f7","amp;dn":"Mercedes+Service+CD+W211+589+14+22+00","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3db7a245c7908776c1cfee779fbfaa2862f65f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,219,122,36,92,121,8,119,108,28,254,231,121,251,250,162,134,47,101,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
