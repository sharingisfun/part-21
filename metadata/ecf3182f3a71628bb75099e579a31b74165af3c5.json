EMI/Capitol Records marked the occasion, and the release of his album of the same name, by lighting up its Hollywood building in red.\n\nNothing But the Beat chronicles Guetta's rise to the pinnacle of the electronica world, from his first gigs in underground gay clubs in France to playing to crowds of 80,000-plus in stadiums and events like the Electric Daisy Carnival around the world. He's interviewed on the road, behind the turntables, awkwardly filming music videos, and in hotel room after hotel room -- all while maintaining good spirits and a sense of humor.\n\n\nThe Huse Monfaradi-directed project, which plays more like a music video or a commercial than a straight documentary, argues that Guetta's hit collaborations with artists like Black Eyed Peas (he produced &quot;I Got a Feeling&quot;), Flo Rida and Nicki Minaj (&quot;Where Them Girls At&quot;), and  Snoop Dogg (&quot;Sweat&quot;) have finally pushed electronica, and specifically house music, into the mainstream.\n\nWill.i.am, Flo Rida, Kelly Rowland, Usher, Ludacris and Snoop reinforce that thesis during their interviews in the film. Snoops says Guetta promised him a No. 1 hit worldwide when they collaborated and Guetta delivered with at least Top 5 rankings in various territories. Rowland, who belted it out in &quot;When Love Takes Over,&quot; calls Guetta's live act a transformative experience.\n\n\nLaidback Luke, Fatboy Slim, Laurent Garnier, David Morales, Pete Tong and 2 Many DJs are also among those who weigh in on Guetta's influence on the music industry in the film. And as one interviewer points out, there would be no electronica genre today if it wasn't for the European market and club culture that Guetta and his contemporaries developed.\n\nJennifer Hudson, Afrojack, Sia, Taio Cruz, Chris Brown, Akon and Jessie J are also featured on various tracks on the Nothing But the Beat album, which celebrated its release with a penthouse party at the Chateau Marmont attended by Will.i.am and others.\n\n\nAsked how he felt about the Nothing But the Beat album at a Q&amp;A following the film screening, Guetta said, &quot;There's no filler in this album. I'm going back to my roots and showing a different side of myself with it.&quot;\n\n\n\n----------------------------\nSpecs:\n\nFormat : MPEG-4 \nFormat profile : Base Media / Version 2 \nCodec ID : mp42 \nFile size : 1.03 GiB \nDuration : 1h 6mn \nOverall bit rate mode : Variable \nOverall bit rate : 2 222 Kbps \n\nVideo \nID : 1 \nFormat : AVC \nFormat/Info : Advanced Video Codec \nFormat profile : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;246c4d434c6468170a15&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; \nFormat settings, CABAC : Yes \nFormat settings, ReFrames : 1 frame \nCodec ID : avc1 \nCodec ID/Info : Advanced Video Coding \nDuration : 1h 6mn \nBit rate : 2 068 Kbps \nMaximum bit rate : 9 318 Kbps \nWidth : 1 280 pixels \nHeight : 720 pixels \nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9 \nFrame rate mode : Constant \nFrame rate : 25.000 fps \nColor space : YUV \nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0 \nBit depth : 8 bits \nScan type : Progressive \nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.090 \nStream size : 980 MiB (93%) \n\nAudio \nID : 2 \nFormat : AAC \nFormat/Info : Advanced Audio Codec \nFormat profile : LC \nCodec ID : 40 \nDuration : 1h 6mn \nBit rate mode : Variable \nBit rate : 152 Kbps \nMaximum bit rate : 259 Kbps \nChannel(s) : 2 channels \nChannel positions : Front: L R \nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz \nCompression mode : Lossy \nStream size : 71.9 MiB (7%) \n\n\nThis is a YouTube rip from the exclusive preview.
