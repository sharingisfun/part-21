As the 20th anniversary of his arrest approaches, Yahoo News is publishing a series of articles based on his letters and other writings, housed in an archive at the University of Michigan. They shed unprecedented light on the mind of Kaczynski â€” genius, madman and murderer.\r\n\r\nTed Kaczynski\r\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\r\n\r\nTheodore John &quot;Ted&quot; Kaczynski (/kÉ™ËˆzÉªnski/; born May 22, 1942), also known as the &quot;Unabomber&quot;, is an American anarchist and serial killer. Between 1978 and 1995, Kaczynski engaged in a nationwide bombing campaign against people involved with modern technology, planting or mailing numerous homemade bombs, ultimately killing a total of three people and injuring 23 others. He is also known for his wide-ranging social critiques, which opposed industrialization and modern technology while advancing a nature-centered form of anarchism.[2][3][4]\r\n\r\nKaczynski was born and raised in Evergreen Park, Illinois. While growing up in Evergreen Park he was a child prodigy, excelling academically from an early age. Kaczynski was accepted into Harvard University at the age of 16, where he earned an undergraduate degree. He subsequently earned a PhD in mathematics from the University of Michigan. He became an assistant professor at the University of California, Berkeley in 1967 at age 25. He resigned two years later.\r\n\r\nAs a Harvard undergraduate, Kaczynski was among twenty-two students who were research subjects in ethically questionable experiments (possibly part of Project MKUltra) conducted by psychology professor Henry Murray from late 1959 to early 1962.[5][6]\r\n\r\nIn 1971, he moved to a remote cabin without electricity or running water, in Lincoln, Montana, where he lived as a recluse while learning survival skills in an attempt to become self-sufficient.[7] 17 years after beginning his mail bomb campaign, Kaczynski sent a letter to The New York Times on April 24, 1995 and promised &quot;to desist from terrorism&quot; if the Times or the Washington Post published his manifesto, Industrial Society and Its Future (also called the &quot;Unabomber Manifesto&quot;), in which he argued that his bombings were extreme but necessary to attract attention to the erosion of human freedom necessitated by modern technologies requiring large-scale organization.\r\n\r\nThe Unabomber was the target of one of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's costliest investigations. Before Kaczynski's identity was known, the FBI used the title &quot;UNABOM&quot; (UNiversity &amp; Airline BOMber) to refer to his case, which resulted in the media calling him the Unabomber. The FBI (as well as Attorney General Janet Reno) pushed for the publication of Kaczynski's &quot;Manifesto&quot;, which led to his sister-in-law, and then his brother, recognizing Kaczynski's style of writing and beliefs from the manifesto, and tipping off the FBI.[8] Kaczynski tried unsuccessfully to dismiss his court appointed lawyers because they wanted to plead insanity in order to avoid the\r\ndeath penalty, as Kaczynski did not believe he was insane.[9] When it became clear that his pending trial would entail national television exposure for Kaczynski, the court entered a plea agreement, under which he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to life in prison with no possibility of parole. He has been designated a &quot;domestic terrorist&quot; by the FBI.[10] Some anarcho-primitivist authors, such as John Zerzan and John Moore, have come to his defense, while also holding some reservations about his actions and ideas.[11][12]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fad12c2f4f5623130212eb98726e4b68f9f3f12a","amp;dn":"Ted+Kaczynski+The+Unabomber","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fad12c2f4f5623130212eb98726e4b68f9f3f12a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,209,44,47,79,86,35,19,2,18,235,152,114,110,75,104,249,243,241,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
