Showcasing the diverse talent of the Northern-bred quintet, it draws on elements of jam, jazz, bluegrass, and roots to capture the signature sound associated with the Floodwood name. Birthed out of the foothills of the Adirondack Mountains, the album features Al Schnier (moe.) on guitar, Nick Piccininni (The Abrams Brothers, The Atkinsons, The Delaney Brothers) on banjo and fiddle, Jason Barady (Wooden Spoon) on mandolin, Zachary Fleitz (Wooden Spoon) on bass, and Vinnie Amico (moe.) adds a unique percussive dimension otherwise unseen in music of this kind. Al, Nick, and Jason all take lead on vocals, and the musical variation of the band makes each track on This is Life take on a form of its own.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“North Country WindsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s opening track, pays homage to the FloodwoodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s northern roots. SchnierÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nostalgic lyrics paint the picture of an isolated Adirondack winter, and Barady opens up the number with a teasing of the mandolin Ã¢â‚¬â€œ soon after the rest of the band follows suit; PiccininniÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fiddle stands at the forefront, and Fleitz and AmicoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rhythms drive the track. The albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s theme is reflected in the track, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Holy SacredÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, a playful tune with a simple message. The track showcases Piccininni on banjo and Ã¢â‚¬Å“This is Life,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ are three words that repeat themselves throughout the tune.\n\nTracks like Ã¢â‚¬Å“Gravel YardÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“CaughtÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ are reflective of Schnier and AmicoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s musical history of experimental jam. Weaving together improvisational, spacey elements with traditional bluegrass form, the tracks hit at the core of what classifies Floodwood as a progressive touring act. Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Magnolia RoadÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a tune with that signature moe. sound fan have grown to love, but the addition of PicinniÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vocals accompanied by strings give it a flavor of its own. Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Stomp ItÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Spoon KicksÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Whiskey after BreakfastÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ are instrumental tunes whose energies are reflective of what one might find when catching Floodwood live. Naturally, these songs set themselves apart from the other tracks on This is Life.\n\nWhile the album gives listeners a taste of the progressive powerhouse that is Floodwood, it merely skims the surface. They are a band not simply to be heard, but one to be seen. To appreciate Floodwood, one must dive deep, but not too deep. The spin they put on traditional form isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t the only thing that characterizes Floodwood as progressive. These days, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re moving along at a rapid pace, playing countless shows throughout the Northeast. And while touring and playing together may be fairly new for this Adirondack-born quintet, their music makes the message clear: for Floodwood, This is Life.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e32aae0b4728ba9f37a7b246595249fb1a57c71e","amp;dn":"Floodwood+-+This+is+Life+%5B2013%5D+%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.FLAC%5D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e32aae0b4728ba9f37a7b246595249fb1a57c71e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,42,174,11,71,40,186,159,55,167,178,70,89,82,73,251,26,87,199,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
