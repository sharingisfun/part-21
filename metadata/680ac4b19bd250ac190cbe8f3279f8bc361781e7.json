He is regarded by critics as one of the finest suspense novelists of the 1950s and 1960s. His 1951 debut, the pulp paperback novel Hill Girl, sold over a million copies. A dozen of his books have been adapted for the screen, most popularly Dead Calm.\n\nOf Williams's twenty-two novels, sixteen were paperback originalsÃ¢â‚¬â€eleven of them Gold Medals; he is described by Gorman as &quot;the best of all the Gold Medal writers.&quot;Pulp historian Woody Haut calls Williams the &quot;foremost practitioner&quot; of the style of suspense that typified American pulp literature from the mid-1950s through the early 1960s: &quot;So prolific and accomplished a writer was Charles Williams that he single-handedly made many subsequent pulp culture novels seem like little more than parodies.&quot;Fellow hardboiled author John D. MacDonald cites him as one of the most undeservedly neglected writers of his generation. O'Brien, singling him out as especially &quot;overdue&quot; for &quot;wider appreciation,&quot; describes Williams as a stylist consistently faithful to &quot;the narrative values which make his books so entertaining and his present neglect so inexplicable.&quot;\n \nGenre: Mystery Hardboiled Crime Fiction\n\nTitles Include -- \n\nA Touch of Death (1954; Gold Medal 434)\nAground (1960; Viking hc)\nAll The Way (1958; Dell A165)\nAnd The Deep Blue Sea (1971; Signet pb)\nBig City Girl (1951; Gold Medal 163)\nDead Calm (1963; Viking hc)\nGirl Out Back (1958; Dell B114)\nGo Home, Stranger (1954; Gold Medal 371)\nGulf Coast Girl (1955; Macmillan hc [reprint: Dell 898])\nHell Hath No Fury (1953; Gold Medal 286)\nHill Girl (1951; Gold Medal 141)\nMan on a Leash (1973; Putnam hc)\nMan On The Run (1958; Gold Medal 822)\nNothing In Her Way (1953; Gold Medal 340)\nRiver Girl (1951; Gold Medal G207)\nTalk of The Town (1958; Dell A164)\nThe Big Bite (1956; Dell A114)\nThe Diamond Bikini (1956; Gold Medal s607)\nThe Long Saturday Night (1966; New American Library hc)\nThe Sailcloth Shroud (1960; Viking hc [reprint: Dell D410])\nThe Wrong Venus  (1966; New American Library hc)\n\n\nIF ANYONE HAS CLASSIC NOIR/MYSTERY TO SHARE OR POST, including the Prologue Crime Series, Soho Crime Series and/or any other vintage titles by the likes of Dan Marlowe, Peter Rabe, Lionel White, Charles Williams, Gil Brewer, etc. please post and/or PM me about sharing.
