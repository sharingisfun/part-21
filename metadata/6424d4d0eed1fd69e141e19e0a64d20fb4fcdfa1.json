The Claridon is an old ship, on its last voyage before heading to the scrap heap. An explosion in the engine room weakens the hull and the ship is now taking on more water that the bilge pumps can deal with. The Captain seems to have difficulty accepting that his ship will sink. Henderson's wife Laurie is severely injured and trapped under a fallen beam. While the men in the engine room work frantically to shore up the hull, Henderson tries to free his wife from the wreckage with the help of one of the crew, Hank Lawson. \r\n\r\nSinopse Pt Br:\r\n\r\nUm navio de luxo, que tem 38 anos de vela e faltando apenas cinco viagens a serem retirados no mar sofre uma tremenda explosÃ£o e comeÃ§a a afundar","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6424d4d0eed1fd69e141e19e0a64d20fb4fcdfa1","amp;dn":"The+Last+Voyage+%5BRobert+Stack%5D+%281960%29+DVDRip+Oldies","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6424d4d0eed1fd69e141e19e0a64d20fb4fcdfa1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,36,212,208,238,209,253,105,225,65,225,158,10,100,210,15,180,252,223,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
