(BH, 2016).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 978-0-12-396975-0\r\n\r\nMultiscale Modeling for Process Safety Applications is a new reference demonstrating the implementation of multiscale modeling techniques on process safety applications. It is a valuable resource for readers interested in theoretical simulations and/or computer simulations of hazardous scenarios.\r\n\r\nAs multi-scale modeling is a computational technique for solving problems involving multiple scales, such as how a flammable vapor cloud might behave if ignited, this book provides information on the fundamental topics of toxic, fire, and air explosion modeling, as well as modeling jet and pool fires using computational fluid dynamics.\r\n\r\nThe book goes on to cover nanomaterial toxicity, QPSR analysis on relation of chemical structure to flash point, molecular structure and burning velocity, first principle studies of reactive chemicals, water and air reactive chemicals, and dust explosions.\r\n\r\nChemical and process safety professionals, as well as faculty and graduate researchers, will benefit from the detailed coverage provided in this book.\r\n\r\n\r\nProvides the only comprehensive source addressing the use of multiscale modeling in the context of process safety\r\nBridges multiscale modeling with process safety, enabling the reader to understand mapping between problem detail and effective usage of resources\r\nPresents an overall picture of addressing safety problems in all levels of modeling and the latest approaches to each in the field\r\nFeatures worked out examples, case studies, and a question bank to aid understanding and involvement for the reader","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f86033af4c5a924d55ed5ae3f2e99ee30074413f","amp;dn":"Multiscale+Modeling+for+Process+Safety+Applications","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f86033af4c5a924d55ed5ae3f2e99ee30074413f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,96,51,175,76,90,146,77,85,237,90,227,242,233,158,227,0,116,65,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
