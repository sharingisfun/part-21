This book is unique in that it details both the management and technical skill and tools required to develop an effective vulnerability management system. Business case studies and real world vulnerabilities are used through the book. This book starts by introducing the reader to the concepts of a vulnerability management system. Readers will be provided detailed timelines of exploit development, vendors' time to patch, and corporate path installations. Next, the differences between security assessment s and penetration tests will be clearly explained along with best practices for conducting both.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:067933b6b9f7ac51370e2b74ef62cbd0051cf2fe","amp;dn":"Network+Security+Assessment","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"067933b6b9f7ac51370e2b74ef62cbd0051cf2fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,121,51,182,185,247,172,81,55,14,43,116,239,98,203,208,5,28,242,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
