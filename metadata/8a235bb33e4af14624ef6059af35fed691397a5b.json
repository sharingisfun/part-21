It was released by Columbia Records on 24 October 2008 as the follow up to her previous English-language compilation, All the Way... A Decade of Song (1999). Before releasing My Love (Essential Collection), Dion had already sold over 200 million albums worldwide. In the album's liner notes, she dedicated this collection of songs, recorded between 1990 and 2008, to her fans who supported her throughout the years. My Love (Essential Collection), was released as a single disc, consisting of Dion's most successful singles, including: &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot;, &quot;Because You Loved Me&quot; and &quot;The Power of Love&quot;. \nThe two-disc edition, entitled My Love: Ultimate Essential Collection has been further expanded to include rare songs that have not previously appeared on her albums. Both editions include a new track, &quot;There Comes a Time&quot;. The album wasn't released in Japan because Sony Music Entertainment Japan decided to issue another compilation, Complete Best in February 2008.  My Love: Essential Collection received a positive response. It topped the albums charts in the Netherlands, Belgium and Ireland, as well as the compilation album chart in France. The first single from the album, &quot;My Love&quot;, is a semi-autobiographic song written for Dion by Linda Perry, originally available on Taking Chances (2007). In France and later in the United States, &quot;I'm Alive&quot; (Remix) was released as a promotional single. \n\nCD - Track Listings\n\n[01] My Heart Will Go On (Love Theme From Titanic - Album Version)\n[02] Think Twice [Album Version]\n[03] It's All Coming Back To Me Now [Radio Edit 1]\n[04] A New Day Has Come [Radio Remix]\n[05] My Love [Live]\n[06] Taking Chances [Album Version]\n[07] That's The Way It Is [Album Version]\n[08] The Power Of Love [Radio Edit]\n[09] Because You Loved Me (Theme From Up Close And Personal - Album Version)\n[10] Tell Him-------------------------------------------------------------------------------Duet With Barbra Streisand\n[11] Falling Into You [Album Version]\n[12] I Drove All Night [Album Version]\n[13] I'm Alive [Album Version]\n[14] All By Myself [Edited Single Version]\n[15] Alone\n[16] Immortality---------------------------------------------------------------------------With Bee Gees\n[17] Beauty And The Beast [From The Soundtrack Beauty And The Beast]-----------Duet With Peabo Bryson\n[18] There Comes A Time\n\nTotal MP3 Play Time............. 01h:18m:07s\nTotal File Size....................... 188mb (Including MP3s + M3u, Videos, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat &amp; Bitrate..................
