Roger Hodgson, Keith Baker, Richard Palmer, and Richard Davies, then together under the name Daddy, performed in public in one of the hippest clubs in Munich, the PN Club. The group changed its name to Supertramp a few months later.\n\nDirector: Haro SENFT\nNationality: German\nLength: 10:22\nProducer: Haro Senft Film Produktion\n\nWhen he undertook to film this rock group then unknown to the general public, Haro Senft certainly didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t suspect that Daddy would become Supertramp. His intention was just to set the music to images, the fruit of the work of four musicians with no desire to glamorise the artists. Supertramp Portrait 1970 is the first short film of its kind.\nFurthermore, loyal to his convictions set down on paper in the Oberhausen Manifesto of 1962, a manifesto according to which he denounced the commercial trappings of the film industry, Haro Senft always refused to sell this film.\n\nWhile SupertrampÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s career took off really quickly, the four musicians always proclaimed their gratitude to the film director. During an interview Richard Palmer, the guitarist declared: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Supertramp Portrait 1970 remains the best documentary on our group to dateÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n\nSupertramp Portrait 1970 is considered to be the documentary that inspired Martin Scorsese who in 1976 filmed the farewell concert of the Canadian group The Band and made a poignant documentary of it two years later called The Last Waltz.
