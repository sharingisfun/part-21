Though not the first compilation from the beloved synth-pop band, THE BEST OF VOLUME 1was its first official single-disc &quot;best-of.&quot; Spanning the entirety of the group&amp;#039;s two-decades-and-running career, the collection includes early confections such as &quot;Just Can&amp;#039;t Get Enough&quot; and &quot;See You,&quot; brooding mid-career classics like &quot;Personal Jesus&quot; and &quot;Enjoy the Silence,&quot; and the clean-and-sober comeback tracks &quot;Suffer Well&quot; and &quot;Precious.&quot; This is as succinct an overview of this classic New Wave band as any available now or (inevitably) soon to be.\n\nBy their very nature, best-of collections lend themselves to nostalgia, and Depeche Mode&amp;#039;s instantly identifiable sound and string of pervasive, catchy singles are undoubtedly the soundtrack to many memories--memories served well by this fine collection of beautifully remastered songs. If you&amp;#039;ve heard any of the band&amp;#039;s double-disc rereleases, you&amp;#039;ll have an idea of just how good their remastered songs can sound. While there are some obvious omissions (&quot;Somebody,&quot; &quot;Policy of Truth&quot;), compiling a career-spanning collection of Depeche Mode&amp;#039;s best would be considered a challenge for just about anybody; and as this is Vol. 1, it seems obvious that there&amp;#039;s more to come. There are a couple odd choices in the mix (&quot;See You,&quot; &quot;New Life&quot;) and the obligatory new track (&quot;Martyr&quot;), but the non-chronological mix makes these classics sound fresh and better than ever. The accompanying DVD in the deluxe edition features 23 videos, including nearly every song on the CD, and a documentary--that&amp;#039;s worth the price of admission alone. --Alan Wiley\n\nCategory Rock/Pop, Synth Pop, Rock\nLabel Reprise \nOrig Year 2006 \nDiscs 1 \nStreet Date Nov 14, 2006 \nStudio/Live Studio \nMono/Stereo Stereo \nProducer Daniel Miller (Compilation); Roland Brown (Compilation) \n    \nSong Title \n \n  1.
