This only works for x64 OS like windows server 2003 x64, Vista 64bit, or XP 64 bit.\n\nInstructions:\nexecute the .exe file and follow the simple instructions.\n\n\nInstalls as Fast-cgi or ISAPI which I recommend. Works with the new .NET 3.0 frame work too...\n\nI searched a long time for a working version of php 64 and thought I should share.\n\nBe sure to use MySQL 64 bit and that your IIS is running in x64 not 32 mode. (64x installed standardly so you would have had to make the change to 32 bit your self if you are using the above OS)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be20c05f95298cda313c49c543dc2b8f9b4a425d","amp;dn":"IIS+5+6.0+7.0++PHP+automatic+installer+for+Windows+x64","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be20c05f95298cda313c49c543dc2b8f9b4a425d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,32,192,95,149,41,140,218,49,60,73,197,67,220,43,143,155,74,66,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
