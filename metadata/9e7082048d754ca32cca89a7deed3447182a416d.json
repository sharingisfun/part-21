May Munro has heard of his skills and tries over and over to convince Ray to bomb the guys who killed her parents once. Ray begins to overshadow May. He is interested in May's case, but still is of the opinion to never use his skills again. The situation changes dramatically when a former CIA comrade of Ray appears on the scene.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/7hMkG6x&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/7hMkG6x&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/vFfNR2w&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/vFfNR2w&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/QlCb1v1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/QlCb1v1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/LBilGnU&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/LBilGnU&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/FBtshPd&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/FBtshPd&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/0cglIlY&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/0cglIlY&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/pel6pO7&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/pel6pO7&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/h9YSB63&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/h9YSB63&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/9i2cVgq&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/9i2cVgq&lt;/a&gt;\n\nCast\n\n\nSylvester Stallone - Ray Quick\nSharon Stone - May Munro\nJames Woods - Ned Trent\nRod Steiger - Joe Leon\nEric Roberts - Tomas Leon\nMario Ernesto Sanchez - Charlie\nSergio Dore Jr. - Strongarm\nChase Randolph - May's Dad\nJeana Bell - May's Mom\nBrittany Paige Bouck - Young May\nEmilio Estefan - Piano Player\nLaGaylia Frazier - 1st Singer\nRamon Gonzalez-Cuevas - Priest at Cemetary\nTony Munafo - Tony\nCheito Quinonez - Singer at Party\nTony Tatis - Backup Singer\nMercedes Enriquez - Pregnant Woman on Bus\nYeniffer Behrens - Schoolgirl on Bus\nScott Blake - 1st Punk\nRex Reddick - 2nd Punk\nJeff Bornstein - 3rd Punk\nAllan Graf - Bus Driver\n\n\n    Director - Luis Llosa\n    Screenplay - Alexandra Seros\n    Executive Producer - Steve Barron\n\n    Executive Producer - Jeff Most\n    Executive Producer - Chuck Binder\n    Producer - Jerry Weintraub\n    Co-Producer - R.

Sylvester Stallone liked Fincher but he was overruled by the producers, because Fincher's career was still in deep freeze after the failure of AlienÃ‚Â³: I teliki anametrisi and wasn't revived until the massive success of Seven.\n\nGoofs\n\nIn the 1984 prologue, Ray and Ned are on a CIA mission in Colombia and are wearing military fatigues. As noted in the Tom Clancy novel Clear and Present Danger, which was set in Colombia during the 1980s, fatigues are not commonly worn by legitimate military personnel in Colombia and would not be used by covert operatives there. The proper &quot;blending in&quot; outfit in this situation would be some kind of khaki gear.\n\nQuotes\nNed: Good, nice sense of irony, blowing up the bomb unit. Ned, you may ask yourself, why is it my turn to die. Ask God. he kills all the time. Why shouldn't I?\n\n\n\n\n*Title.....................: The Specialist\n*Genre.....................: Crime | Mystery | Thriller\n*Encoded/Released By.......: tomcat12\n*Year/Language.............: 1994/English\n*Source....................: BLURAY\n*Type/Writing Library......: MPEG-4 AVC/ x264 core 133 r2334 rc=2pass\n*Conteiner.................: mp4\n*File size.................: 3.42 GiB\n*Overall Bit Rate..........: 4 446 Kbps\n*Video Bit Rate............: 4 000 Kbps\n*AUDiO:....................: AAC / 6CH / 448 Kbps\n*Resolution................: 1 920 x 1 080 pixels\n*FPS/AR....................: 23.976 fps/16:9\n*Runtime/sample...................: 1h 49mn/01min\n*SUBTiTLES idx:.................: English (SDH),Danish,Dutch,Finnish,French.\n*SUBTiTLES idx:.................: German(SDH),Italian(SDH),Norwegian,Port.-Braz.\n*SUBTiTLES idx:.................: Spanish Castilian,Spanish -Latin American.\n*SUBTiTLES srt:.................: Arabic,Bulgarian,Danish,Dutch,English,Finnish,\n*SUBTiTLES srt:.................: Greek,Hebrew,Romanian,Slovenian,Spanish.            \n\n\nMenu\n\n\n00:00:00.000 : Both Dead Men\n00:05:25.324 : Her Only Hope\n00:09:18.140 : Sticky With Blood\n00:12:17.653 : Tip Refused\n00:14:28.951 : What Tomas Wants\n00:18:21.934 : Vacating A Seat\n00:20:38.403 : With Tomas\n00:23:49.886 : In Ray's Eye\n00:27:48.667 : &quot;My Problem Now&quot;\n00:30:43.258 : Doorway To Death\n00:34:34.113 : Ned In Control\n00:36:42.158 : All Part Of Work\n00:39:42.380 : Police Cooperation\n00:41:54.094 : Craziest Person\n00:45:34.606 : What Each Sees\n00:47:50.742 : Bye-Bye\n00:53:27.078 : Three Thrateners\n00:57:00.500 : Poolside Cat/Mouse\n01:00:51.105 : A Grieving Father\n01:04:35.705 : Hold The Phone\n01:09:03.973 : Churchgoers\n01:12:44.651 : May/Ray Close Up\n01:17:26.016 : Unworthy Of Trust\n01:20:43.463 : Incendiary Welcome\n01:23:15.615 : Mess In Kitchen\n01:24:54.506 : Very Good On Phone\n01:29:02.962 : Double M Seafood\n01:32:18.950 : Tightening The Net\n01:33:49.081 : Unfinished Business\n01:35:37.481 : Nice Sneak Attack\n01:39:44.311 : All Deserve To Die\n01:42:18.841 : Seconds To Oblivion\n01:44:30.889 : A Kind God\n01:45:20.022 : End Credits\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e7082048d754ca32cca89a7deed3447182a416d","amp;dn":"The+Specialist+1994+1080p+BDRip+AAC+x264-tomcat12","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e7082048d754ca32cca89a7deed3447182a416d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,112,130,4,141,117,76,163,44,202,137,167,222,237,52,71,24,42,65,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
