JOE IDW run so far, minus Hearts and Minds which has been hard for me to find seeded.\n\nAs for this being &quot;in order&quot;, I need to explain: The Origins series, as well as the first story arc of G.I Joe (vol 1, Cobra and Cobra II) are in chronological order. Everything after that, however, is simply in the order of publication. I had no real chronology and haven't had a chance to read through it all myself yet, but I figured I'd get this up (for now) just so folks could have easy access to an awesome series without having to hunt all over.\n\nAnyways, enjoy, PLEASE keep it seeded, and as always, if you like it, support the official release! Even snagging TPBs off Amazon helps keep it going.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:033ac7926c5e474937660db3cf1a2e24b275f14d","amp;dn":"G.I.+JOE+%28IDW%29+Collection+-+In+Order","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"033ac7926c5e474937660db3cf1a2e24b275f14d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,58,199,146,108,94,71,73,55,102,13,179,207,26,46,36,178,117,241,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
