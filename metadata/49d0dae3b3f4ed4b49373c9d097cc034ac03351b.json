Bells chime as more tonal voices emerge from the ether, WalkerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s acoustic guitar echoing in the abyssal soundscape. Several women sing as sirens: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Beautiful Sun.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The piece is inspired by and takes its name from an essay written by Truman Capote following his interview with Manson-associate Bobby Beausoleil (which translates as Ã¢â‚¬Å“beautiful sunÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), whose dangerous spirit and embodiment of occult ideals offer an extreme example of the light into dark transition the piece explores. As the soft drones and angelic voices are replaced with threatening rumbles of distortion and low cackles courtesy of Wrest, an overwhelming sense of unease permeates the pieceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s atmosphere, only a harbinger of what is to come. When the piece does explode into crushing howls and heavy doom, all semblance of tranquility and stillness, the light, the peace, is exterminated.\n\n\n\nTracklist: \n01.
