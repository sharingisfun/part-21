Hey You is found on tapes and more modern releases. There's a bit of trivia for the day.\n\n- Big Papi\n\n\nBy J. A. Bellamy\n\nThe music on this cd has been blasted out of my speakers more than any other in the past thirteen years. And that's saying alot. Around 1989, I got rid of my old blue jam box and upgraded to a cd player. This meant tossing my Cure tape and moving over to the cd. Thus, this is also the first album I have purchased twice. Now, I still put it in my (even newer) stereo, but its not for nostalgic reasons. This is fantastic music and has something to offer everyone.\n\nThe Kiss is perhaps the darkest song I've every heard, and is the first one on this album I fell in love with. Like Cockatoos has that bass line that mingles with your blood. If Only Tonight We Could Sleep is so unique and strange that it almost redefines what music is. It's nearly narrative. And Just Like Heaven, as somebody else said in another review, really is the perfect pop song.\n\nThe Cure has metamorphosed more times that other bands have albums, but Robert Smith's melancholic voice has always been there, droning about misery or rejoicing in giddiness. This album, though currently not directly centered, serves as the perfect fulcrum to their incredible body of work.\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nCure, The - Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Cure, The\nAlbum................: Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me\nGenre................: Pop/Rock\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1987\n\nMP3 V0 (Highest Quality Available For MP3)\n\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Extreme, (avg. bitrate: 269kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.
