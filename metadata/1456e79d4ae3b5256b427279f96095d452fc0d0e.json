You should also check that the MD5 matches the MD5 found online.\n\n\nVirus scanner results\n\nAll virus scanner detection's are a false-positive as long as the MD5 matches. Simply turn off your anti-virus while installing the loader.\n\n-\nVersion 2.1.8 (12/15/2012)\n* Added a new GRLDR (required to support Server 2012 operating systems)\n* Added support for Windows Server 2012 Standard, Essentials, Foundation &amp; Datacenter\n* Added support for Windows Storage Server 2012 Standard &amp; Workgroup\n* Added support for Windows MultiPoint Server 2012 Standard &amp; Premium\n* Added HEDY Windows 7 Ultimate key\n* Added ByteSpeed, DakTech, Genuine C&amp;C, INSYS, WIPRO &amp; Zoostorm Windows 7 Professional keys\n* Added ByteSpeed &amp; INSYS Windows 7 Home Premium keys\n* Added AOC &amp; ByteSpeed Windows 7 Starter keys\n* Added AOC, ByteSpeed, EXTRA Computer GmbH, Mustek, Velocity and Western Digital v2.1 SLIC's and certificates\n* Added a Dell v2.2 SLIC to activate 2012 server editions (only recommended for Server 2012 unless you're dual booting with Windows 7/Vista)\n* Added new launch parameters\n* Fixed a Windows key decoding bug\n* Fixed the &quot;Licensed&quot; text color for BIOS activated systems\n* Other minor tweaks and fixes\n\nVersion 2.1.7 (07/19/2012)\n* Fixed a bug that was causing the RSDT to get trashed\n\nVersion 2.1.6 (07/19/2012)\n* Added a new GRLDR version\n* Fixed a Hyper-V installation issue\n* Added Tangent Professional serial\n* Added Dealin Starter serial\n\nEXE MD5: a9246b3ce4aa617439df9da9838e9e48\nEXE SHA-1: 04855efb9bf805df1fcd6c492a44128d6533182f\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1456e79d4ae3b5256b427279f96095d452fc0d0e","amp;dn":"Windows.7.Loader.v2.1.8-DAZ+%2832Bit-64Bit%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1456e79d4ae3b5256b427279f96095d452fc0d0e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,86,231,157,74,227,181,37,107,66,114,121,249,96,149,212,82,252,13,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
