Cassie's biggest 'fan'-a serial killer-is on a spree, cleaning up her loose ends. That means no foe or friend is safe.

Cassie Hack, killer of killers, and her partner Vlad hunt a slasher who haunts a small town's Make Out Point. Meanwhile, Cat Curio, Former Teen Detective, searches for the man who put her in a coma and the murderous cult that employed him. What she finds will set up the biggest Hack/Slash story yet.
