M. Pradier, Y. J.

It will describe how to characterise amino acids, protein or bacterial strain interactions with metal and oxide surfaces, by using infrared spectroscopy, in vacuum, in the air or in an aqueous medium. Results will highlight the performances and perspectives of the technique.\r\n\r\nDescription of the principles, expermental setups and parameter interpretation, and the theory for several advanced IR-based techniques for interface characterisation\r\nContains examples which demonstrate the capacity, potential and limits of the IR techniques\r\nHelps finding the most adequate mode of analysis\r\nContains examples\r\nContains a glossary by techniques and by keywords","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7cb9f81844578d2e76db206cc90cb899bdb7c90","amp;dn":"Biointerface+Characterization+by+Advanced+IR+Spectroscopy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7cb9f81844578d2e76db206cc90cb899bdb7c90","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,203,159,129,132,69,120,210,231,109,178,6,204,144,203,137,155,219,124,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
