Hitler, played by Albin Skoda, alternately flames with wild-eyed hope or flares into fits of screaming fury, while his staff generals languish, paralyzed, and the various smaller people in the bunker fearfully or fatalistically await their doom. There is a great deal of military detail about the final deterioration and collapse of the armies and the Luftwaffe. The representation of the flooding of the Berlin subway at Hitler's lunatic command, even though it was full of civilians and wounded soldiers in hospital cars, makes a vivid, violent sequence. And a scene of an orgy in the bunker on the night that Hitler died, with one nurse doing a lurid danse macabre, is a weird and delirious thing.\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo: MPEG4 Video (H264), 624x480, 24.996 fps, 1850 Kbps, 01h47m00s\r\nAudio: AAC, 48000 Hz, stereo\r\n\r\nDVDRip, German audio, optional subtitles English and Russian\r\n\r\ncover: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/7lg8iwern/\r\n\r\nscreenshots: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/4nt0ayzfv/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/o3eeh6503/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/xmo3amsib/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/5la1wxn83/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:39f846fe5aac2e0aa70c0fb01dfc137ed8f379b4","amp;dn":"Der+letzte+Akt+%281955-Germany%29+%5BHitler%3A+Last+Ten+Days%5D+en%2Bru+subs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"39f846fe5aac2e0aa70c0fb01dfc137ed8f379b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,248,70,254,90,172,46,10,167,12,15,176,29,252,19,126,216,243,121,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
