Charlton Heston, Anne Baxter, Gilbert Roland to name just a few. Strong cast, great story, action.  All around good western.\n\nWide screen, color, english, no subs, dvd rip, excellent quality.\n\nAnother exception to my no duplicates rule.  It is here on TPB but apparently it is no longer supported by the original seeder and several people are asking for it.  Once again, the movie is too good to let die here.\n\nIMDB:\nFormer dance hall girl Lorna, masquerading as a lady, meets and marries Confederate ex-officer Colt Saunde","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c992eff7eb43f1c3432266588af9c7eb73e50a27","amp;dn":"Three+Violent+People+-+1957.DVDRip.XviD.AC3%5BENG_PTBR%5D-CST.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c992eff7eb43f1c3432266588af9c7eb73e50a27","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,146,239,247,235,67,241,195,67,34,102,88,138,249,199,235,115,229,10,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
