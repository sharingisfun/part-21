On 1 September 1939, the date of Hitler's assault on Poland, his army numbered 3,180,000 - this figure would grow to 9,500,000 before dropping back to 7,800,000 by the time of the unconditional German surrender in May 1945. The range of specialist uniforms and equipment that were developed in response to the different demands of each theatre of war, from the days of Blitzkrieg advance to the final retreat, are all described and illustrated. Hilter's major campaigns in Western Europe, the Soviet Union, North Africa and the Balkans are also summarized.\r\n\r\n**PLEASE SEED**","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:425bd01ff9a5e2e87c9e4e4d3081b9b0c7516fa6","amp;dn":"The+German+Army+in+World+War+II+-+Nigel+Thomas","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"425bd01ff9a5e2e87c9e4e4d3081b9b0c7516fa6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,91,208,31,249,165,226,232,124,158,78,77,48,129,185,176,199,81,111,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
