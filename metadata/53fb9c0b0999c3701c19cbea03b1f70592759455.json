Two Headed Monster hits with a slam. The alchemical blend that they concoct feels dark and surreal, sensual and twisted...a pure delight for the senses. Your body and soul suspended, you are absorbed into their world. It s not a bad place to be. In fact, you may want to exist there forever. \n\n\nTrack Listing\n\n1. Tongue Tied &amp; Twisted\n2. Chaotic\n3. A Little Too Much\n4. Pure Bliss\n5. Spaces In Between\n6. Silently Creeping\n7. Head Spin\n8. Two Headed Monster\n9. Shifting\n10.
