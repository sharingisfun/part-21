I'm super-jealous I couldn't get my hands on a good-quality copy of Fetch! to include. My version also has many more subtitle versions, but not Italian (you might notice my version has much better synchronization of subtitles, too). Still, the interview, Fetch, and the &quot;official&quot;ness make this version one to include in your collection.\n\n\nSita Sings the Blues\nDirected, written, produced, designed and animated by Nina Paley\n82 minutes\nAnimation\nColor, stereo\n2008\n\nSynopsis:\n\nSita is a goddess separated from her beloved Lord and husband Rama. Nina is an animator whose husband moves to India, then dumps her by email. Three hilarious shadow puppets narrate both ancient tragedy and modern comedy in this beautifully animated interpretation of the Indian epic Ramayana. Set to the 1920's jazz vocals of Annette Hanshaw, Sita Sings the Blues earns its tagline as &quot;the Greatest Break-Up Story Ever Told.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c734949e128fc498e40efbce728b5d2d84e4a2b","amp;dn":"Sita+Sings+the+Blues+OFFICIAL+DVD+%28NTSC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c734949e128fc498e40efbce728b5d2d84e4a2b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,115,73,73,225,40,252,73,142,64,239,188,231,40,181,210,216,78,74,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
