Although she had sung briefly with Duke Ellington on two occasions in 1943 and the early '50s, fame had eluded RochÃƒÂ©. After this album she would record two more records (available in the Original Jazz Classics series) over the next few years and then disappear back into obscurity. Assisted by vibraphonist Eddie Costa, trumpeter Conte Candoli, pianist Donn Trenner, bassist Whitey Mitchell, and drummer Davey Williams, RochÃƒÂ© is heard at her best on this set of standards. Highlights include a remake of &quot;Take the 'A' Train&quot; (she had previously recorded a classic version with Ellington), &quot;Something to Live For,&quot; &quot;Route 66,&quot; and &quot;September in the Rain.&quot; Two additional versions of &quot;Go Away Blues&quot; round out the excellent release.
