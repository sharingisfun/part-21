Sawyer - Factoring Humanity\nFactoring Humanity is a 1999 Hugo Award Nominee for Best Novel.\n\nIn the near future, a signal is detected coming from the Alpha Centauri system. Mysterious, unintelligible data streams in for ten years. Heather Davis, a professor in the University of Toronto psychology department, has devoted her career to deciphering the message. Her estranged husband, Kyle, is working on the development of artificial intelligence systems and new computer technology utilizing quantum effects to produce a near-infinite number of calculations simultaneously.\n\nWhen Heather achieves a breakthrough, the message reveals a startling new technology that rips the barriers of space and time, holding the promise of a new stage of human evolution. In concert with Kyle's discoveries of the nature of consciousness, the key to limitless exploration---or the end of the human race---appears close at hand.\n\nSawyer has created a gripping thriller, a pulse-pounding tour of the farthest reaches of technology","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7db66385eaab8e416f870bb8abd257de7d8520f","amp;dn":"Robert+J.+Sawyer+-+Factoring+Humanity","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7db66385eaab8e416f870bb8abd257de7d8520f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,219,102,56,94,170,184,228,22,248,112,187,138,189,37,125,231,216,82,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
