Now they look realistic and varied.\n-Completely overhauled sounds system. Using headphones is highly recommended.\n-Unique soundtrack that was specifically compiled for The Journey and includes over 170 carefully chosen tracks. You wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t find it on Nexus or anywhere else.\n-All cities and villages were redesigned. Many shops and taverns now have unique interiors.\n-Many new places to discover including new villages, dungeons and secret hideouts.\n-Vastly expanded wildlife with animals acting more realistic. Monsters list expanded tenfold and youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll meet new creatures even after hundreds of hours of playtime.\n-TONS of new loot, armors and weapons. New cool enhancements. New rare artifacts. Treasure hunting is now much more rewarding. But no ridiculous looking or overpowered stuff, everything fits well into Skyrim.\n-Hundreds of new and balanced magic spells. Playing mage now is tougher early but very rewarding later on.\n-In fact all specializations are much more fun to play now and have its own benefits.\n-Dynamic unforgiving combat that makes you to think, react and prepare for every fight. Even wolves and bandits can give you troubles, while dragons and dragon priests will eat you alive if you arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t prepared.\n-Hundreds of new NPCs that populate roads and cities. Many random encounters making the world feel much more alive. You wont miss fast travel.\n-Fully integrated Skyrim Redone overhaul that changes perk trees to make leveling more rewarding and fun. \n-Several huge DLC mods including Falskaar, Wyrmstooth, Moonpath to Elsweyr, Wheels of Lull, each offering at least 10 hours of gameplay.\n-Revamped economy. Making money is now harder, everything is expensive but quests are more rewarding to do.\n-Better vampires and werewolves gameplay.\n-Hardcore roleplay and survival. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll have to eat, drink, rest, care for warmth or experience severe debuffs and even death.\n-Many quality of life improvements. Things you will probably not notice since it feels natural. But will miss badly if return to vanilla.\n-Thousands and thousands of bug fixes.\n-Close to a hundred compatibility patches to make everything work as one piece.\n-Challenging, refreshing gameplay. Fast travel is disabled, starting carry weight is way lower, you can wear only limited amount of potions, arrows and lockpicks, automatic health regen is disabled, traps are deadly, locks are tough to break, leveling is slow, training/crafting takes time. On top of that The Journey features unique permadeath system where you can actually loose your character forever if not careful. But its not one death = game over and you can play through without a single reload. Read more on death mechanics and other useful info in readme.\n-So stable you will not believe it. \n \nScreenshots gallery: http://imgur.com/a/QPkwE\n\nFollow closely installation instructions in readme.
