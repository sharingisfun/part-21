Although his guitar playing is pretty raw, even by blues standards, John Lee more than compensates with his powerful, resonant voice. Several tracks, including &quot;Burnin' Hell&quot; and &quot;You Live Your Life And I'll Live Mine&quot; are downright frightening in their intensity. Although Robert Jr. Lockwood is often indentified as Robert Johnson's successor, this album would seem to indicate that Hooker is the most likely candidate to have a hellhound on his trail.\n\nThis is part of Riverside's Original Blues Classics series.\n\nRecorded at United Recorders, Detroit, Michigan on April 20, 1959\n\nTrack Listings\n1.
