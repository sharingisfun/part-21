ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a capable little PC which can be used for many of the things that your desktop PC does, like spreadsheets, \n    word-processing and games. It also plays high-definition video. We want to see it being used by kids all over the world to learn programming.\n\n    As of now there are two models of the Raspberry Pi, and A and a B. Model A has been redesigned to have 256Mb RAM, one USB port and no Ethernet (network connection). Model B has 512Mb RAM, 2 USB port and an \n    Ethernet port.\n\n    Sources: http://www.raspberrypi.org\n            &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.raspberrypi.org/faqs&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.raspberrypi.org/faqs&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nPidora 18 (Raspberry Pi Fedora Remix)\n============================================\nPidora is a Linux software distribution for the Raspberry Pi computer. It contains software packages from the Fedora Project (specifically, the Fedora ARM secondary architecture project) compiled specifically for the ARMv6 architecture used on the Raspberry Pi, packages which have been specifically written for or modified for the Raspberry Pi, and software provided by the Raspberry Pi Foundation for device access. \n\n    Pidora 18 (Raspberry Pi Fedora Remix) will be the fourth version of the Remix released.\n\n        Release date: (May 22nd 2013)\n        Fedora package collection version: 18\n        Kernel version: (3.6.11)\n        Architecture: armv6hl\n\n    Sources: http://pidora.ca/\n\n\nWhat is Pidora\n====================\n    Pidora is a combination of Fedora software, with or without third-party software, that any community member can create at any time.\n    (More Info in the source link)\n\n    Source: http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Remix\n\n\n\nSetting up the Raspberry Pi for the First Time\n==============================================\n    This is the recommended system configuration for first time startup:\n\n        Connect the Raspberry Pi to a high-definition monitor or TV using the HDMI output (HDMI and DVI-D are basically the same signals, so an HDMI-DVI adapter can be used).\n        Connect a USB keyboard (and, optionally, a USB mouse).\n        Plug in an ethernet cable connected to an IPv4 network with a DHCP server and Internet gateway. Pidora will use this connection to set the system clock.\n        Insert the SD card.\n        Apply power. \n\n\nSD Card Installation Using the Installer\n========================================\n    The easiest way to install the Remix is to use the installer program.\n    Instructional Video:\n\n    Needed:\n\n            A computer with at least 5 GB of free disk space, running one of these operating systems:\n                Fedora\n                Windows Vista or Windows 7\n                Other Linux \n            An SD or SDHC card, with a capacity of 2GB or more. (Good-quality class 4 cards usually work well).\n            An SD/SDHC card writer, either built in to the computer or connected to a USB port.\n            An Internet connection. \n\nBefore Proceeding Note!\n\n    Danger of Data Loss / System Damage\n    The selected device will be overwritten. If you select the wrong device, you may lose data. Exercise care when using the installer program.\n\n    Download the installer from the appropriate link:\n\n     Official Fedora Wiki Page: http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Fedora_ARM_Installer \n\nINSTRUCTIONS: \n\n    Run the installer. \n    Click the refresh (circle-arrow) button beside the Download list to retrieve a list of available images.\n    Select the image you wish to install (&quot;Pidora 18 (Raspberry Pi Fedora Remix)&quot;) -- or, if you have already downloaded the image file, browse to that file's location.\n    Click the refresh (circle-arrow) button beside the Device list to retrieve a list of possible target devices for the installation.\n    Select the device on which you wish to install the image (WARNING: all data on this device will be deleted! - be sure you have selected the correct device).\n    Click &quot;Install&quot;.\n    Wait until the program states that the installation is complete before removing the card. \n\n\nSD Card Installation Using the command line\n===========================================\n    The image can also be installed using the Unix/Linux dd command.\n\n    Needed:\n\n            A computer with at least 5 GB of free disk space, running some form of Unix or Linux.\n            An SD or SDHC card, with a capacity of 2GB or more. (Good-quality class 4 cards usually work well).\n            An SD/SDHC card writer, either built in to the computer or connected to a USB port.\n            An Internet connection. \n\nBefor Proceeding Note!!!\n\n    Danger of Data Loss / System Damage\n    The selected device will be overwritten. If you select the wrong device, you may lose data. Exercise care when using the installer program.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n\n    Download the image - see the Downloads page on the Pidora 18 site.\n       &lt;a href=&quot; http://pidora.ca/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://pidora.ca/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n    Insert your SD/SDHC card into the card reader, and attach to the computer if necessary.\n    Identify the device node of the SD card (this will be something like /dev/sdc or /dev/mmcblk0).\n    Do not use a partition device node (for example: use /dev/sdc or /dev/mmcblk0, not /dev/sdc1 or /dev/mmcblk0p1).\n    An easy way to identify the card is to list the device nodes (ls -l /dev/sd* /dev/mmcblk*) before and after inserting the SD card. \n    Device nodes that that appear when the card is inserted correspond to the card. \n    Ensure that the device is unmounted.\n    Copy the image file to the card: dd if=/dev/NameOfImageFile of=/dev/DeviceNode\n    Ensure that the image is fully written onto the card: sync\n    Remove the card. \n\n\nPidora 18 Firmware\n=================\n    Current Version:\n        raspberrypi-vc-20130815gite0590d6-1\n    Date Released:\n        Aug 15, 2013\n\n\nChanges For Pidora\n=====================\n    In Regards to this Raspberry Pi Fedora Remix the following changes have been made for this release:\n    \n    - Compiled specifically to take advantage of the hardware already\n        built into the Raspberry Pi\n    - Graphical firstboot configuration (with additional modules\n        specifically made for the Raspberry Pi)\n    - Compact initial image size (for fast downloads) and auto-resize\n        (for maximum storage afterwards)\n    - Auto swap creation available to allow for larger memory usage\n    - C, Python, &amp; Perl programming languages available &amp; included\n        in the SD card image\n    - Initial release of headless mode can be used with setups\n        lacking a monitor or display\n    - IP address information can be read over the speakers and\n        flashed with the LED light\n    - For graphical operation, Gedit text editor can be used with\n        plugins (python console, file manager, syntax highlighting)\n        to serve as a mini-graphical IDE\n    - For console operation, easy-to-use text editors are included\n        (nled, nano, vi) plus Midnight Commander for file management\n    - Includes libraries capable of supporting external hardware\n        such as motors and robotics (via GPIO, I2C, SPI)\n\n\nReporting A Bug\n===============\n    If you notice a bug that we are not currently aware of feel to file a ticket, and lets us know about it.\n       &lt;a href=&quot; http://trac.proximity.on.ca/projects/rpfr/report&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://trac.proximity.on.ca/projects/rpfr/report&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3bea867cd255e7ca49bee9541172f59692a6c1b","amp;dn":"Pidora+18","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a3bea867cd255e7ca49bee9541172f59692a6c1b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,190,168,103,205,37,94,124,164,155,238,149,65,23,47,89,105,42,108,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
