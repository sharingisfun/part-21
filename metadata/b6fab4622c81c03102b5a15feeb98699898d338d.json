The Crime Syndicate was a twisted mirror image of the Justice League and had first appeared in Justice League of America #29 in August 1964. The group continued to cause trouble from its homeworld of Earth-3 until reality was destroyed in Crisis on Infinite Earths (1986). Post-crisis, a variation of the group had appeared in Summer 1992's Justice League Quarterly#8 but had very little to do with the original team - unlike Morrison's makeover.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b6fab4622c81c03102b5a15feeb98699898d338d","amp;dn":"JLA+-+Earth+2+%282000%29+%281920+HR%29+%28Minutemen-DTs%29.cbz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b6fab4622c81c03102b5a15feeb98699898d338d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,250,180,98,44,129,192,49,2,181,161,95,238,185,134,153,137,141,51,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
