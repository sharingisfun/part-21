It doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;t take much more space than a floppy disk. If you do not have need for exclusive high-end recording software, but just want to make easy midifiles or just edit a midifile this is the program for you. Just install and run - no patches or serial needed.\n\nEnglish language","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed8d1ba77b39e96db675a7dde470cadd5129a111","amp;dn":"Cubasis","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed8d1ba77b39e96db675a7dde470cadd5129a111","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,141,27,167,123,57,233,109,182,117,167,221,228,112,202,221,81,41,161,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
