One of AmericaÃƒÂ¢??s most original and influential public intellectuals, his focus is the social dimension of creativity: how creative work builds on the past and how society encourages or inhibits that building with laws and technologies. In his two previous books, CODE and THE FUTURE OF IDEAS, Lessig concentrated on the destruction of much of the original promise of the Internet. Now, in FREE CULTURE, he widens his focus to consider the diminishment of the larger public domain of ideas. In this powerful wake-up call he shows how short-sighted interests blind to the long-term damage theyÃƒÂ¢??re inflicting are poisoning the ecosystem that fosters innovation.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0bc3ffb7778a9be7b594e6623e9579844a6f086c","amp;dn":"freeculture.pdf.gz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0bc3ffb7778a9be7b594e6623e9579844a6f086c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,195,255,183,119,138,155,231,181,148,230,98,62,149,121,132,74,111,8,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
