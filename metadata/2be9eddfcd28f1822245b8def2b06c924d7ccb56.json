Fortunately I saw it before. Ray's episode was easily one of the worst of the 6th Season.\n\nThis one with Karen Black is one of the funniest and it's the next one in order.\nIt was also the first show with Eddie Murphy as a full cast member.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2be9eddfcd28f1822245b8def2b06c924d7ccb56","amp;dn":"SATURDAY+NIGHT+LIVE+--+Karen+Black%2C+Cheap+Trick+%28+6th+Season+%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2be9eddfcd28f1822245b8def2b06c924d7ccb56","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,233,237,223,205,40,241,130,34,69,184,222,242,176,108,146,77,124,203,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
