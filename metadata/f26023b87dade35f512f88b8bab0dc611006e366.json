It is &quot;FIGHT&quot;!\n\nThis is the video adaptation of the most comprehensive handgun course in the world that everyone is talking about! Tactical ResponseÃƒÂ¢??s Fighting Pistol course prepares you to prevail in a real world violent confrontation and now this video captures the Mindset, Tactics, and Legal lectures that Tactical Response has become famous for and it takes you for a one-on-one range session with James Yeager. This intensive video set covers an incredible amount of material so watch it with a note pad!\n\nTopics include the role and attributes of the handgun, Mindset, Tactics, legal aspects of deadly force, anatomical stopping power, and mental conditioning for combat. Live fire drills include both one- and two-handed shooting, shooting on the move, use of cover and concealment, tactical-emergency-and speed loading, using both eye level and retention techniques, at a variety of ranges and from a variety of tactical body positions.\n\nThis video is only for serious practitioners and is HEAVY with lecture on mindset, tactics, skill, and legal issues so if you are looking for another ÃƒÂ¢??shoot ÃƒÂ¢??em upÃƒÂ¢?? video set that doesnÃƒÂ¢??t address the REAL issues than this one is not for you. There is rangetime in this set but it mostly concentrates on the mental aspects of fighting.&quot;\n\nThere is over 4 1/2 hours of video contained in this set.  This is an excellent set.  It is in .rv format; there is no avi or wmv files for this set I could find.  It is well worth downloading though.\n\n~~~\n\nI am always adding new things, so check this account often.\n\nVisit roguesci (dot) org (slash) theforum, and register, for the world&amp;#039;s longest running largest explosives and weapons forum on the web!\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f26023b87dade35f512f88b8bab0dc611006e366","amp;dn":"The+Fighting+Pistol%3B+3+Video+Set","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f26023b87dade35f512f88b8bab0dc611006e366","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,96,35,184,125,173,227,95,81,47,136,184,186,176,220,97,16,6,227,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
