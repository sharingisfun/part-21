Firestone - Kant and Theology at the Boundaries of Reason\nPublisher: Ashgate | 2009-08-28 | ISBN: 075466130X | PDF | 208 pages\n\n\nThis book examines the transcendental dimension of Kant's philosophy as a positive resource for theology. Firestone shows that Kant's philosophy establishes three distinct grounds for transcendental theology and then evaluates the form and content of theology that emerges when Christian theologians adopt these grounds. To understand Kant's philosophy as a completed process, Firestone argues, theologians must go beyond the strictures of Kant's critical philosophy proper and consider in its fullness the transcendental significance of what Kant calls 'rational religious faith'. This movement takes us into the promising but highly treacherous waters of &quot;Kant's Religion within the Boundaries of Mere Reason&quot; to understand theology at the transcendental bounds of reason.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:99048ddeed41a2b9bd6293846ba75422f72dbff2","amp;dn":"Kant+and+Theology+at+the+Boundaries+of+Reason+-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"99048ddeed41a2b9bd6293846ba75422f72dbff2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,4,141,222,237,65,162,185,189,98,147,132,107,167,84,34,247,45,191,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
