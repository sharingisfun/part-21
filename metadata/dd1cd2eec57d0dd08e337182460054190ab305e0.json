The series was written by Marv Wolfman, and illustrated by George PÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©rez (pencils/layouts), with Mike DeCarlo, Dick Giordano, and Jerry Ordway (who shared inking/embellishing chores). The series eliminated the concept of the Multiverse in the fictional DC Universe, and depicted the deaths of such long-standing superheroes as Supergirl and the Barry Allen incarnation of the Flash.\n\nThe title of the series was inspired by earlier crossover stories involving the multiple parallel Earths of the Multiverse, such as &quot;Crisis on Earth-Two&quot; and &quot;Crisis on Earth-Three&quot;, but instead of lasting two to five issues and involving members from as many superhero teams from as many parallel worlds, it involved virtually every significant character from every parallel universe in DC's history. It in turn inspired the titles of seven subsequent DC crossover series: Zero Hour: Crisis in Time (1994), Identity Crisis (2004), Countdown to Infinite Crisis (2005), Infinite Crisis (2005-2006), 52 (2006-2007), Countdown to Final Crisis (2007-200 and Final Crisis (200.\n\nMust-read stuff.\n\nEnjoy, and please seed so that others may enjoy also.
