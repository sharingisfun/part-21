Although not reaching the top ten in the UK, it recently went platinum, and was already platinum around the rest of the world just after its release. The album features many of Meat Loaf's best-known songs as well as a few from his lesser known albums of the 1980s.  Besides hits like &quot;Paradise by the Dashboard Light&quot; and &quot;I'd Do Anything for Love (But I Won't Do That)&quot;, The Very Best of Meat Loaf contains three new tracks. Two of those are written by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Jim Steinman and are adapted from their musical Whistle Down The Wind; both of these tracks were produced by Steinman. The third new track, &quot;Is Nothing Sacred&quot; is written by Steinman and lyricist Don Black, and produced by Russ Titelman (the single version of this song is a duet with Patti Russo, whereas the album version is a solo song by Meat Loaf. The single version would later appear on the VH1 Storytellers CD).  Both Bat out of Hell and Bat out of Hell II: Back into Hell are prominently featured with five tracks from the first and four from the second. The album did not feature any songs from his 1986 album Blind Before I Stop.  The album was rereleased in 2003 with the same tracks in a different order.\n\nCD-01 - Track Listings\n\n[01] Home By Now / No Matter What\n[02] Life Is A Lemon And I Want My Money Back (Remix)\n[03] You Took The Words Right Out Of My Mouth (Hot Summer Night)\n[04] Two Out Of Three Ain't Bad\n[05] Modern Girl\n[06] Rock And Roll Dreams Come Through\n[07] Is Nothing Sacred\n[08] Paradise By The Dashboard Light\n[09] Heaven Can Wait\n\n\tCD-01 Play Time - 00h:57m:08s\n\nCD-02 Track Listings\n\n[01] I'd Do Anything For Love (But I Won't Do That)-----Featuring Lorraine Crosby\n[02] A Kiss Is A Terrible Thing To Waste-----Featuring Bonnie Tyler\n[03] I'd Lie For You (And That's The Truth)-----Featuring Patti Russo\n[04] Not A Dry Eye In The House\n[05] Nocturnal Pleasure\n[06] Dead Ringer For Love----Duet With Cher\n[07] Midnight At The Lost And Found\n[08] Objects In The Rear View Mirror May Appear Closer Than They Are\n[09] Bat Out Of Hell\n\n\tCD-02 Play Time - 00h:59m:57s\n\nTotal FLAC Play Time............ 01h:57m:05s\nTotal File Size....................... 798mb (Including FLAC + Logs, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat / Info.......................
