However, having lost his sixth sense and the ability to see \nspirits, Masahiro struggles to prove himself that he is more then just \n&quot;Seimei's grandson&quot;. Out of nowhere, a mononoke begins to follow Masahiro \naround, who then decides to call the mononoke Mokkun. Without realising, \nMokkun is actual the fearsome Touda, or Guren as Seimei has named him, \none of Seimei's twelve shikigamis. With the assistance of Mokkun, Masahiro \nbegins to battle the spirits haunting their city, and perhaps develop his \ninnate ability that could even surpass Seimei. \nBased on the novel by Yuuki Hikaru.\n\n\nFormat                           : Matroska\n\nVideo: MPEG4 Video (H264) 720x480 (16:9) 29.97fps\nAudio: AAC 48000Hz stereo [Audio]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ecd52c51aca2b36c904fd5ffc33648ac9ba512ac","amp;dn":"Shounen+Onmyouji+%5BComplete+Series%5D%28Eng+Dub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ecd52c51aca2b36c904fd5ffc33648ac9ba512ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,213,44,81,172,162,179,108,144,79,213,255,195,54,72,172,155,165,18,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
