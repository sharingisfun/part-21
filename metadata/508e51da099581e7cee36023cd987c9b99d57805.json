Building applications with the .NET Framework to run on Windows Server 2003, architects, developers, and administrators are significantly more productive than they are with alternatives. With .NET's multi-language support, developers can use the language they prefer, whether it is Java, C#, VB.NET, C++, or even COBOL, Fortran, or RPG. Visual Studio 2005 is the industry's premiere developer tool suite, and provides a range of tools that help individual developers and software development teams to work smarter, not harder; to communicate more effectively within your software teams; to learn new skills more quickly; and to translate software into business benefit more rapidly.\n\tInteroperability\n\nNo system is an island. Interoperability is a fundamental requirement for any application server, and that's why we've designed interoperability capabilities into the core of .NET and Windows Server 2003. The .NET Framework v2.0 includes support for key industry standards in the areas of Web services, XML, and security. In addition to de jure standards, Windows also supports vendor-specific protocols and products. So, whether you run your operational data in Oracle or DB2; whether you have packaged software from SAP or Pivotal or Microsoft; and whether you have existing systems running in CICS, WebSphere, or WebLogic, applications written for the Windows application server can interoperate with what you've got.\n\tPeak Performance and Scalability\n\nUsing the .NET Framework 2.0 on Windows Server 2003, server-based applications enjoy an automatic throughput boost. Your applications can server 25 percent more Web services transactions as compared to .NET v1.1, 200 percent more XML DOM operations, or 100 percent more XML pull-parse operations. E-commerce applications can reach extreme scale using the 64-bit version .NET 2.0 Framework, with over 800 times more throughput than 32-bit .NET 2.0, by taking advantage of a large server-based memory cache.\n\tExtreme Scalability\n\nWindows scales up, and down. Run your applications on the full range of server hardware, from inexpensive, single-processor servers to multi-CPU, multi-core 64-bit capable systems for extreme scale. Regardless of your expected application load, rest assured that Windows Server 2003 can handle it, cost efficiently.\n\tEnterprise-Class Reliability and Availability\n\nReliability is enhanced through a range of new and improved features including memory mirroring, Hot Add Memory, and health detection in Internet Information Services (IIS) 6.0. Built-in Network Load Balancing provides scale-out capability on commodity server hardware for improved availability in the face of network failures. You can also use hardware load balancers with the Windows application server. All of this adds up to enterprise-grade reliability.\n\tValue\n\nStudies show that Windows Server 2003 with the .NET Framework can cost significantly less than other comparable commercial application server products. In simple configurations, software licenses for a Windows Server application server system can cost one-half as much as software from other companies. In more complex deployments using multiple servers and multi-CPU servers, the savings are even more dramaticÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Windows can cost one-tenth the cost of the competition. But more than that, the ease-of-use of Windows Server means developers and administrators are more productive, saving on the soft costs. Better value is why CheckFree selected Windows over IBM WebSphere. Windows Server is the value leader in application servers.\n\tOptimized for Shared Hosting of Custom Applications\n\nWindows Server 2003 and the .NET Framework 2.0 allow even more efficient use of server resources by commonly-located applications. IIS 6.0, part of Windows Server 2003, enables multiple independent applications to be hosted on a single, shared server. Administrators can provision servers to start applications on demand, or to always reserve a portion of system resources for a given set of applications. This allows consolidation of applications on larger servers, which can reduce staffing costs, hardware costs, and site management costs.\n\tIntegrated Services\n\nWindows Server 2003 includes a broad set of integrated services, including a high-performance Web server, Message Queuing, an LDAP server with X.509 support, high performance transaction management, an integrated performance monitor, and Network Load Balancing. Windows Server 2003 also includes Enterprise UDDI Services, a directory for Web services and data schema. Windows Server 2003 R2 adds Active Directory Federation Services, for single-sign on capability. Other application server products require you to separately license, purchase, install, and maintain infrastructure for each of these pieces. With Windows, &quot;it's in there.&quot;\n\tSecurity\n\nResearchers from the Security Innovation collaborating with researchers from the Florida Institute of Technology found that the number of vulnerabilities and average days of risk were lower for the a Web Application server based on Windows Server 2003, as compared to a Linux-based alternative. This supports a 2004 study from Forrester who found similar results, and it complements an April 2005 study from WiPro that found the total cost of security-related updated management to be lower for Windows than for Linux-based alternatives. Windows Server 2003 is designed to be security-enhanced from the very start. And new tools in Visual Studio 2005 help developers analyze the level of security of custom code, before it gets deployed.\n\tExtensible with the Windows Server System\n\nMicrosoft Windows Server System is a portfolio of integrated server software products that provides the infrastructure for IT operations, application development and integration, security, and collaboration. Built with Common Engineering Criteria and support for open industry standards, Windows Server System makes it easier to connect and manage your IT environments. Windows Server 2003 is the foundation for the Windows Server System, delivering core infrastructure and common services, including a common application programming model, common developer tools, a common diagnostic and performance management mechanism, common update policies and procedures, common documentation, and more. With Windows Server 2003 as your base, you have access to the broad platform capability of the Microsoft software application platform, supporting the growth of your enterprise, whether it is large or small.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:508e51da099581e7cee36023cd987c9b99d57805","amp;dn":"WINDOWS+SERVER+2003+X86+R2+SP2+DATACENTER+WORKSTATION","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"508e51da099581e7cee36023cd987c9b99d57805","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,142,81,218,9,149,129,231,206,227,96,35,205,152,124,155,153,213,120,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
