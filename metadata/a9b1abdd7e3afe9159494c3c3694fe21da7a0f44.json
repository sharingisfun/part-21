A short while later, Danny Turner is found in his car at the bottom of a ravine, after having taken his own life. \n\nAny explanation as to why a loving father and husband would suddenly commit a series of such heinous crimes has gone to the grave with the accused. The mystery only deepens as the details of the murders emerge, and evidence of premeditation as well as DannyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hidden past are revealed. \n\nSubsequently, RachelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s closest friend, Carolyn Bianci, sinks into a deep depression, while her husband, Mitch, copes with his despair by attempting to uncover the facts of the crime. Eventually they encounter Joanna Larson, a fascinating woman who possesses extraordinary spiritual gifts. \n\nThrough Joanna, the truth about the events that took place the night of the murders are unveiled. The answers Mitch and Carloyn get are beyond their human understanding.\n\nInspired by true events, The Ravine is a story of faith, forgiveness, and most of all, the restoration of hopeÃ¢â‚¬â€even for the most seemingly unredeemable among us.\n\nGenre: Mystery","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9b1abdd7e3afe9159494c3c3694fe21da7a0f44","amp;dn":"The+Ravine+by+Robert+Pascuzzi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9b1abdd7e3afe9159494c3c3694fe21da7a0f44","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,177,171,221,126,58,254,145,89,73,76,60,54,148,254,33,218,122,15,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
