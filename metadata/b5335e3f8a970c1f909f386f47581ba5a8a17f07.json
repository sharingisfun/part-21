I brought upon myself the mission\nat hand to make these things sound halfway decent.\nI will admit I am not an audio engineer, but you\nhave to admit my &quot;audio facelift&quot; has made these demos sound bettter.\nBefore I touched these recordings, they sounded too soft.\nI hope I did a good job and that all of you out there reading\nthis will agree.  I used Cool Edit Pro 2 to fix these tracks.\nEnjoy!  I got the original tracks from iDX.  Props to them releasing the tracks\nfirst to the scene.  I just made them better.\n\nProps to the inner and neg crew.  I love you all.  Thanks for all your support.\n\nP.S.  Track 13 has clicks.  That&amp;#039;s not me.  That&amp;#039;s from the originals.  I did\nnot cause that.  I just made the tracks sound louder.
