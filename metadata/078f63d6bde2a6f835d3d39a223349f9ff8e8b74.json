ThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Tilly Devine, who went from streetwalker in London to wealthy Sydney madam and standover merchant; Mary Bryant, the highway robber and First Fleeter who escaped by rowing from Port Jackson to Timor with her two children; Lola Montez, the Irish-born grande horizontale, who destroyed King Ludwig I of Bavaria; Ellen Tremaye and Marion Edwards, women who challenged the gender order and became men; and Helena Rubinstein, who rewrote her humble Polish background and became one of the most successful and astute businesswomen in the world.\n\nFrom bushrangers, courtesans and cross-dressers, to writers, designers and a radical or two, what these splendid rebels have in common is a determination to take their destinies into their own hands.\n\nKay Saunders AM was Professor of History and Senator of the University of Queensland from 2002 to 2006. In 2001 she received the Medal of the National Museum of Australia, and in 2006 was the recipient of the John Kerr Medal from the Royal Historical Society of Queensland.\n\n***RE_UPLOADED*****","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:078f63d6bde2a6f835d3d39a223349f9ff8e8b74","amp;dn":"Notorious+Australian+Women.ePub+-+reuploaded","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"078f63d6bde2a6f835d3d39a223349f9ff8e8b74","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,143,99,214,189,226,166,248,53,211,211,154,34,51,73,249,255,142,139,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
