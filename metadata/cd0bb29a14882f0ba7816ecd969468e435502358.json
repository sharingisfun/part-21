It was released a month prior to the album and reached No. 2 on the UK singles chart. The song is faster and heavier than most Iron Maiden songs, and is the band's first single co-written by Janick Gers.\n\nThe B-side features two official songs and one hidden track, including an original blues number (&quot;Nodding Donkey Blues&quot;) and Montrose cover (&quot;Space Station No. 5&quot;), and the spoken word message to the French fans by Bruce Dickinson \n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n    &quot;Be Quick or Be Dead&quot; (Bruce Dickinson, Janick Gers) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:24\n    &quot;Nodding Donkey Blues&quot; (Iron Maiden) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:11\n    &quot;Space Station #5&quot; (Montrose cover; Ronnie Montrose, Sammy Hagar) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:47\n    &quot;Message To The French Fans&quot; (Dickinson)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd0bb29a14882f0ba7816ecd969468e435502358","amp;dn":"Iron+Maiden+-+Be+Quick+Or+Be+Dead+%5BSingle%5D+%5B320k+MP3%5D+REPOST","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd0bb29a14882f0ba7816ecd969468e435502358","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,11,178,154,20,136,47,11,167,129,110,205,150,148,104,228,53,80,35,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
