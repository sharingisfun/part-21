This original vinyl pressing features a baker's dozen tracks, all recorded one spring when the charming Mance Lipscomb was out in California doing the folk revival circuit. Like most of his albums, this one is a good example of his versatility. Just when a listener thinks they have the man's style mentally pigeonholed, then along comes something else quite surprising. It is instructive to hear his &quot;Spanish Flang Dang&quot; in comparison with Elizabeth Cotton. Both are talented fingerpickers, and both are relying on memory to reconstruct a hit instrumental record from the early '30s. The variations are fascinating. The blues material here is also strong, ranging from the tough &quot;Cocaine Done Killed Me Baby&quot; to the light-hearted &quot;Boogie in A.&quot; Producer Chris Strachwitz did a great job with the sound, and it is the type of acoustic guitar tone that really sounds better in analog.
