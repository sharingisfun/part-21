With his deep, polished voice and a Yuletide countenance that speaks volumes of merriment, Ives on record is still the closest thing we have to a real singing Santa Claus. Here, in a fine collection of his holiday work, he interprets 15 standards that range from his trademark &quot;A Holly Jolly Christmas&quot; and &quot;Silver and Gold&quot; (from the still popular Claymation film Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer) to the bigger production numbers of &quot;Silver Bells&quot; and &quot;What Child Is This?&quot; In between, there's that distinctive, finely honed folk voice playfully delivering the goods on &quot;The 12 Days of Christmas&quot; and &quot;The Little Drummer Boy.&quot; Got the urge for a feel-good, timeless sing-along? Ives is the one to lead the party.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4bd7dd65c80a0ef6bdbde4f5b1a1cbdfefddc46b","amp;dn":"Burl+Ivesl+-+Very+Best+Of+Burl+Ives+Christmas%2C+The+-+%5BCDRip+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4bd7dd65c80a0ef6bdbde4f5b1a1cbdfefddc46b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,215,221,101,200,10,14,246,189,189,228,245,177,161,203,223,239,221,196,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
