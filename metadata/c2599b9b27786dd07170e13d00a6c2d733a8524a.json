Recognition of other file systems is implemented for informational puposes only.\r\n\r\nFAT file system features quite good chances for recovery of deleted files unless they're overwritten. Powerful tools used by Raise Data recovery for FAT increase chances to recover lost data with maximum possible data recovery result.\r\n\r\nThe software work applying the same powerful mechanisms as UFS Explorer Standard Recovery software that enable efficient recovery of accidentally deleted data and data lost due to logical file system damages after formatting hard disk, hardware malfunctions or software failures, virus attacks, power outages etc. With Raise Data Recovery you can recover data from your PC, USB flash drive, memory card of your photo/video camera, external hard drive as well as from disk images and virtual machines formatted with such file system. For enhanced capabilities the software were supplemented with plug-ins for reconstruction and further recovery from complex RAID-systems as well.\r\n\r\nDespite restrictions that limit data recovery to one file system, the software recognizes other file systems as well - Windows (NTFS, FAT); Apple Mac OS (HFS+); Linux (Ext2, Ext3, Ext4 , Reiser, XFS, JFS (JFS2) and FreeBSD (UFS/UFS2). Raise Data Recovery will detect file system type and find lost and deleted data that allows you to define file system type and select Raise Data Recovery software for your file system.\r\n\r\nWorking with Raise Data Recovery you can be absolutely sure of complete safety of your data. The software work in a safe read-only mode and don't alter original information. Besides, you don't need any prior technical skills for work with these programs. User-friendly interface and ease-of-use make them a perfect solution even for non-experienced users.\r\n\r\nReasonable price of the software focused on your file system type will save your money and fast-working powerful software mechanisms will save your time.\r\n\r\n\r\nKey features\r\n\r\nParticular specialization on FAT file system recovery\r\nThe software is adopted to efficiently search for lost FAT, FAT32 or ExFAT-formatted file systems and recover lost or deleted files.\r\n\r\nImmediate data access for consistent file systems\r\nThe software allows to access data on all the supported file systems, including file systems stored on disk images, virtual disk, RAID storages etc. without the need of prior scan.\r\n\r\nSupport of disk images and virtual disks\r\nThe software allows to open disk images and virtual disks produced by virtual machines of leading virtualization software vendors (including VMware Player, VMware Workstation, Microsoft Virtual PC, Microsoft Hyper-V, Parallels Desktop etc.). This application operates virtual disks and disk image files exactly as if they were physical disks and allows to access or recover lost data from disk images and virtual disks.\r\n\r\nOptional RAID recovery\r\nWith optional module - RAID Access Plugin - RAID Builder - the software supports virtual reconstruction of RAID system after failure of controller or RAID metadata. The program virtually builds RAID and reads its files and folders as if it was physical RAID storage. The software easily handles both simple RAID configurations (such as stripe set - RAID level 0, Span, Mirror - RAID level 1) and complex RAID such as RAID 5 and RAID 6. RAID-on-RAID feature allows to build RAID configurations of high complexity such as RAID 50, RAID 60 etc. Optional support of Runtime Software Virtual Image Files with RAID Access Plugin - VIM Import allows to set up custom RAID configuration with different data distribution algorithms.\r\n\r\nComprehensive files recovery\r\nThe set of tools implemented in the software provides solutions for most practical data loss cases. Depending on situation the software either simply reads or conducts deep analysis of file system metadata to find lost files. Even if the metadata is lost permanently, this program can guess file allocation basing on file system specifics, other files allocations and file content analysis to produce maximally successful data recovery result even in severe data loss cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpecifications\r\n\r\nSupported host operating systems:\r\n\r\n    Microsoft Windows: all starting with Windows NT version 5.1 (Windows XP/2003) and above; \r\n\r\nSupported host computer architectures:\r\n\r\n    Intel Architecture, 32-bit (IA-32, x86) - for all operating systems;\r\n    AMD64 (x86-64) - for all operating systems. \r\n\r\nSupported file systems for recovery:\r\n\r\n    NTFS: recognition only;\r\n    FAT/FAT32: full support (access and advanced recovery);\r\n    ExFAT: full support (access and advanced recovery);\r\n    SGI XFS: recognition only;\r\n    Apple HFS+: recognition only;\r\n    JFS (IBM JFS2): recognition only;\r\n    Ext2-Ext4: recognition only;\r\n    ReiserFS: recognition only;\r\n    UFS/UFS2: recognition only;\r\n    Custom Adaptec UFS: recognition only;\r\n    Sun ZFS: recognition only;\r\n    Novel NWFS: recognition only;\r\n    HFS: recognition only. \r\n\r\n* - the rate of deleted files recovery can be low due to the file system design\r\n** - deleted files may be unrecoverable due to the file system design\r\n\r\n\r\nSystem requirements\r\n\r\nSystem configuration:\r\n\r\n    any of supported operating systems;\r\n    at least 20MB free disk space for software executable files;\r\n    at least 1GB RAM.\r\n \nhttp://www.ufsexplorer.com/rdr_fat.php","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c2599b9b27786dd07170e13d00a6c2d733a8524a","amp;dn":"Raise+Data+Recovery+for+FAT+v5.18.4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c2599b9b27786dd07170e13d00a6c2d733a8524a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,89,155,155,39,120,109,208,113,112,225,61,0,166,194,215,51,168,82,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
