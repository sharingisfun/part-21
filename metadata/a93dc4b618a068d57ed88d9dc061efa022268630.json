It featured all sorts of irreverent takes on various Lanterns, from Alan Scott to G'Nort and the last issue even had an appearance from Lobo. Some stories were humorous and others were more dramatic, but it was a nice fun little series that was ended by the events of the Emerald Twilight storyline and the transformation of Hal Jordan into Parallax. This torrent contains all 8 issues, thanks to the original scanners but I don't know who they are. Please seed, enjoy! :-) ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a93dc4b618a068d57ed88d9dc061efa022268630","amp;dn":"Green+Lantern+Corps+Quarterly+01-08+%281992-1994%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a93dc4b618a068d57ed88d9dc061efa022268630","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,61,196,182,24,160,104,213,126,216,141,157,192,97,239,160,34,38,134,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
