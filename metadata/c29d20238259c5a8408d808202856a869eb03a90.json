Incredibly, instead of fulfilling the order with high-quality arms, Efraim Diveroli, David Packouz, and Alex PodrizkiÃ¢â‚¬â€the dudesÃ¢â‚¬â€bought cheap Communist-style surplus ammunition from Balkan gunrunners. The dudes then secretly repackaged millions of rounds of shoddy Chinese ammunition and shipped it to KabulÃ¢â‚¬â€until they were caught by Pentagon investigators and the scandal turned up on the front page of The New York Times.\n\nThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the Ã¢â‚¬Å“officialÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ story. The truth is far more explosive. For the first time, journalist Guy Lawson tells the thrilling true tale. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a trip that goes from a dive apartment in Miami Beach to mountain caves in Albania, the corridors of power in Washington, and the frontlines of Iraq and Afghanistan. LawsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s account includes a shady Swiss gunrunner, Russian arms dealers, corrupt Albanian gangsters, and a Pentagon investigation that impeded AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s war efforts in Afghanistan. Lawson exposes the mysterious and murky world of global arms dealing, showing how the American military came to use private contractors like Diveroli, Packouz, and Podrizki as middlemen to secure weapons from illegal arms dealersÃ¢â‚¬â€the same men who sell guns to dictators, warlords, and drug traffickers.\n\nThis is a story you were never meant to read","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c29d20238259c5a8408d808202856a869eb03a90","amp;dn":"Arms+and+the+Dudes+%282015%29.epub+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c29d20238259c5a8408d808202856a869eb03a90","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,157,32,35,130,89,197,168,64,141,128,130,2,133,106,134,158,176,58,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
