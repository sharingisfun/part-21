Hughes was so obsessed with perfection in the aerial sequences that he waits forever for perfect conditions, right down to cloud formations. The Aviator ends in 1946, when Hughes was still a dashing young man and romancing actresses like Ava Gardner and Katharine Hepburn.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/7gGPT2Q&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/7gGPT2Q&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/LiaBC4E&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/LiaBC4E&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/1eCjm75&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/1eCjm75&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/9EdBr8z&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/9EdBr8z&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/PnhGGiA&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/PnhGGiA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/yYk9pyk&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/yYk9pyk&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/16IqUBN&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/16IqUBN&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/ympHRdq&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/ympHRdq&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/wJicWqI&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/wJicWqI&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nCast\n\n\n\n\n\nMEDIA-INFO\n\nStyle-Movie colors\n\nHughes crashes in a field; screenshot showing the simulated bipack color film used in scenes depicting events before 1935.\n\n\nFor the first 50 minutes of the film, scenes appear in shades of only red and cyan blue; green objects are rendered \n\nas blue. This was done, according to Scorsese, to emulate the look of early bipack color films, in particular the Multicolor process, which \n\nHughes himself owned, emulating the available technology of the era. Similarly, many of the scenes depicting events occurring after 1935 \n\nare treated to emulate the saturated appearance of three-strip Technicolor. Other scenes were stock footage colorized and incorporated \n\ninto the film. The color effects were created by Legend Films.\n\nMy opinion is in all the movie  Scorsese f@@k up with colors but he is the boss!\n\n\n\nBox Office\n\n\nBudget:$110.000.000 (estimated)\nOpening Weekend:$629.474 (Japan) (25 March 2005)\nGross:$102.608.827 (USA) (27 May 2005) \n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\nFour of the miniature airplanes used in creating the effects for the film are now on display at the Evergreen Aviation Museum in \n\nMcMinnville, Oregon, home of the real Howard Hughes HK-1 &quot;Spruce Goose&quot;. Models on display include two of the biplanes from the \n\nHell's Angels sequence, most of the XF-11 model, and the motion-control &quot;Spruce Goose&quot;. The &quot;Spruce Goose&quot; model is remarkably \n\ndetailed, and even includes scale puppets of Howard Hughes and Dr. Fritz.\n\nGoofs\nWhen first in the Coconut Grove, Howard Hughes orders a &quot;milk with the cap still on&quot;. When Howard receives the milk there is no cap on \n\nit. \n\nQuotes\n[first lines]\nAllene Hughes: Q-u-a-r-a-n-t-i-n-e.\nYoung Howard Hughes: Quarantine. Q-u-a-r-a-n-t-i-n-e.
