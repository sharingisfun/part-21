You may criticise the frigid musical expression or wish, their work had been more refined, but we\\'re talking about one of the most important contributors of early seventies\\' progressive rock. As alumni of Miles Davis (1969 - Bitches Brew), McLaughlin together with Cobham established a band that progressed without brake control, always full of steam. The technical skills are unbelievable. The first albums of Mahavishnu Orchestra are highly praised as cornerstones of a new term, called \\&quot;Jazzrock\\&quot;. They apparently influenced King Crimson\\'s music style during the Bruford/Wetton era and even Zappa\\'s 3rd M.O.I. incarnation in \\'73/\\'74.\n\nIt\\'s not recommended to listen to their stuff everywhere at any time, but in small doses for some moments Easter and Christmas might coincide.\n\n\nThis torrent contains the studio recordings of Mahavishnu\\'s legendary first line-up:\n\n- John McLaughlin (Guitar)\n- Rick Laird (Bass)\n- Billy Cobham (Percussion)\n- Jerry Goodman (Violin)\n- Jan Hammer (Keyboards)\n\nAlbums:\n\n1971 - The Inner Mounting Flame (MFSL)\n1973 - Birds Of Fire\n1973 - The Lost Trident Sessions (first released 1999)\n\nInfos:\n\nMahavishnu Orchestra\n- &lt;a href=&quot; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahavishnu_Orchestra&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahavishnu_Orchestra&lt;/a&gt;\n- &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.progarchives.com/artist.asp?id=649&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.progarchives.com/artist.asp?id=649&lt;/a&gt;\nJohn McLaughlin\n- &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.progarchives.com/artist.asp?id=2627&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.progarchives.com/artist.asp?id=2627&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d1a424ee27e8e196dcc8e8d661648ba9bd1ca2c","amp;dn":"Mahavishnu+Orchestra+-+First+Line-Up+Studio+Albums+%281971-1973%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d1a424ee27e8e196dcc8e8d661648ba9bd1ca2c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,26,66,78,226,126,142,25,109,204,142,141,102,22,72,186,155,209,202,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
