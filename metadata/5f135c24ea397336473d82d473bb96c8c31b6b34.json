It was mixed by Tony Espie (The Avalanches, New Buffalo, Robert Palmer), at 001 Studios in Melbourne. Cyclic Defrost's Vaughan Healey described a typical gig as &quot;a bewildering ride through dynamic tempo changes, finger clicks and swapped instruments. You never really know who is going to sing or what will happen next, and somehow the eight-piece juggles this anarchic structure with a music class worth of instruments and staging rearrangements.&quot;[\nFor the ARIA Music Awards of 2005, the album received three nominations: 'Best Independent Release', 'Best Cover Art' (by Bird) and 'Best Adult Contemporary Release'.[The song &quot;It'5!&quot; (pronounced &quot;it's five&quot;) received wide airplay on the national radio network Triple J and reached No. 56 in their annual Hottest 100 for 2005.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f135c24ea397336473d82d473bb96c8c31b6b34","amp;dn":"Architecture+in+Helsinki-+In+Case+We+Die+%282005%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f135c24ea397336473d82d473bb96c8c31b6b34","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,19,92,36,234,57,115,54,71,61,130,212,115,187,150,200,195,27,107,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
