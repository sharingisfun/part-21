Unfortunately, it is too cold there for an outdoor track, and QWOP has come to the championships without completing his training!\n\nYou can help QWOP achieve his sporting dreams! You just need to show him how to run.\n\nControl QWOP's legs and arms by moving your thumbs around in the diamonds on the screen. Move your thumbs in clockwise circles to make him run. Make QWOP lean forward and back by tilting your device.\n\nAnd whatever you do, don't let QWOP's body touch the ground!\n\nFeatures: \n\n- Five game modes: 100m, Hurdles, Long Jump, Steeplechase, and 50km Walk! \n- Hilarious physics engine.\n- Compete on Google Game Services leaderboards!\n\nMore info:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.noodlecake.QWOP&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.noodlecake.QWOP&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d45265152a710e1bbf2d36e0d51c5d119e2e95f7","amp;dn":"QWOP+v1.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d45265152a710e1bbf2d36e0d51c5d119e2e95f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,82,101,21,42,113,14,27,191,45,54,224,213,28,93,17,158,46,149,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
