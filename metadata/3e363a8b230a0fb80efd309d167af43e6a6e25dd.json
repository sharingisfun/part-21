He is a board member of Budd Hopkins\\&amp;#039; Intruders Foundation and is co-author of Left at East Gate: A First-Hand Account of the Bentwaters-Woodbridge UFO Incident, Its Cover-Up and Investigation. Peter is a current contributor to Phenomena Magazine, UFO Magazine, UFO Report Japan, FATE magazine, www.phemonenamagazine.com, www.UFOdata.uk, among others. \n\nRobbins has lectured extensively both in the States and abroad. His topics have included the U.K.Ãƒâ€ s RAF Bentwaters-Woodbridge UFO incident; the suppression of UFO information by the American and British Governments; James Vincent Forrestal, first Secretary of Defense and early casualty of UFO secrecy; Dr. Wilhelm Reich and UFOs; the UFO abduction phenomenon; crop circles, and the media and UFOs. \n\nIn the early 1950s,the brilliant physician and scientist Dr. Wilhelm Reich developed the cloudbuster, a simple yet effective apparatus capable of altering the weather. Some of these weather modification operations attracted UFOs - first over Maine in 1953; then on December 14, 1954 these experiments culminated in what can only be characterized as a \\&amp;#039;battle\\&amp;#039; in the skies over Tucson. Wild as this may sound, they were well-documented and witnessed. Reich kept the U.S. Air Force apprised of his sightings and weather work at the same time the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) was attempting to build a case against him. The interstate shipment of a medical device (unauthorized by Dr. Reich) resulted in a contempt charge, conviction, and his incarceration. Wilhelm Reich was found dead in his cell in 1957 just prior to his scheduled release. What were the scientific dynamics behind Reich\\&amp;#039;s successful alteration of weather fronts? What part did the Air Force play in his undoing? What were the specifics of his 1940-44 contacts with Albert Einstein? Was MJ-12 involved in his death? Peter Robbins spent years investigating this story and in addressing these questions, draws from Reich\\&amp;#039;s out of print writings. Today Reich\\&amp;#039;s staggering contributions to science are all but forgotten, his name and work derided and distorted by all but a small core of practitioners, scholars &amp; scientists. But none of this alters the facts of this remarkable story.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e363a8b230a0fb80efd309d167af43e6a6e25dd","amp;dn":"Orgone%2C+Reich%2C+weather+modification+and+the+link+to+UFOs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e363a8b230a0fb80efd309d167af43e6a6e25dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,54,58,139,35,10,15,184,14,253,48,157,22,122,244,62,106,110,37,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
