The distortion unit inside RP-Distort can be combined with an analog modeled filter, compressor and widener unit.\n\nThese units can be re-order, but also can be turned on or off. So in case you only want a great analog modelled filter... RP-Distort can offer this. Or only the unique widener unit which is great for widening a boring mono track.\n\nOn top of that, the controls can be modulated using midi sources or by one of the 4 build in LFOÃƒÂ­s that can sync to your host tempoÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nThe distortion unit offers 22 distortion types included ring modulator and lo-fi. Inside this section you can also find the EQ and noise-gate.\n\nRP-Distort is in fact a wicked FX unit that will distort or alter your tracks in an inspirational way.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://www.robpapen.com/rp-distord.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://www.robpapen.com/rp-distord.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nImportant Note: thx R2R for the permission of this release and respect to this very hard working team.\n\nbe fair, buy after try\ndon`t make money with warzed apps\nsupport developer you like, we do this too\n\nGreetz\nall our friends in reallife\n--= TEAM Xdb 2012 =--\n\nfuture-dada  MMXIV.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:953a87fc5e0e2d1dc5f34bea0d043076988ac92b","amp;dn":"Rob+Papen+-+RP-Distort+v1.0c+-+OS+X+-Xdb+%5Bpacket-dada%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"953a87fc5e0e2d1dc5f34bea0d043076988ac92b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,58,135,252,94,14,45,29,197,243,75,234,13,4,48,118,152,138,201,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
