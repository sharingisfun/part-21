His father is dead, his mother is missing, and he was just rescued by an enormous man named Frankenstein. Jamie is brought to Department 19, where he is pulled into a secret organization responsible for policing the supernatural, founded more than a century ago by Abraham Van Helsing and the other survivors of Dracula. Aided by Frankenstein's monster, a beautiful vampire girl with her own agenda, and the members of the agency, Jamie must attempt to save his mother from a terrifyingly powerful vampire.\n\nDepartment 19 takes us through history, across Europe, and beyond - from the cobbled streets of Victorian London to prohibition-era New York, from the icy wastes of Arctic Russia to the treacherous mountains of Transylvania. Part modern thriller, part classic horror, it's packed with mystery, mayhem, and a level of suspense that makes a Darren Shan novel look like a romantic comedy. - Goodreads Summary of Department Nineteen (Department Nineteen #1)\n\nNote: Mainly for a young adult audience, and takes a different approach at the idea of vampires as opposed to what a lot of other YA books tend to make it out to be. Full of action and suspense, it is a recommendable fiction book that is &quot;guy-friendly&quot;, however girls love it as well! Give it a shot.
