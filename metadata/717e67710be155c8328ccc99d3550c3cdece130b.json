The patent is for specific parts \nof the genetic material of pigs which Monsanto&amp;#039;s genetic researchers \nhave decoded. If this patent is granted, pig breeding would be \npossible with the approval of the company.\n\nFarmers and breeders are naturally alarmed because these genes have \nlong existed in the great majority of their pigs. Using DNA tests \nthey can prove that there is no new invention in the patent \napplications but that, instead, granting this patent would be to \nallow a part of nature to fall into the hands of a single company.\n\nMonsanto&amp;#039;s influence on the patent offices is huge. If the patent \nis approved, money will have to be paid to Monsanto for every pig \nin the world carrying this genetic marker. This has long been the \ncase for certain feedstuffs, such as genetically modified maize. \nMany farmers in the US have already become dependent on the company.\nIt is not merely a question of money, however, but also a question \nof the risk posed to consumers. In America, as in Europe, cases of \ninfertility in animals fed with genetically modified maize are \nbecoming increasingly common. No-one yet knows what effects such \nproducts are having on humans.\n\n____________________________________________________________Encoding__\n\nFile Name....: Monsanto - Patent For a Pig (2006-TVRip-d0x).avi\nFile Size....: 399 MB (or 408,858 KB or 418,670,592 bytes)\nFrames.......: 624x352 (1.77:1) [=39:22] @ 0.213 bits/pixel\nVideo Codec..: XviD @ 1172 kb/s\nAudio Codec..: MP3 @ 128 kb/s (64/ch, stereo) CBR \n_________________________________________________________________d0x__","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:717e67710be155c8328ccc99d3550c3cdece130b","amp;dn":"Monsanto+-+Patent+For+a+Pig","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"717e67710be155c8328ccc99d3550c3cdece130b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,126,103,113,11,225,85,200,50,140,204,153,211,85,12,60,222,206,19,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
