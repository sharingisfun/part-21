They signed to Virgin and three albums followed, Below the Belt (1975), Absolutely (1977) and Bloodletting (1979), which also featured Bobby Tench and Boz Burrell. The band dissolved after Absolutely when Patto became ill.\n\nThe band was managed by Nigel Thomas who secured a five album deal over five years with CBS, reputed to have been worth Ã¢â€Â¬ÃƒÂº1.2 million and was never fully executed due to Patto's death on 4 March 1979. During a six-year period Boxer also toured the US and Europe.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBloodletting was an album by the rock band Boxer, released on the Virgin record label in 1979. Their third album in order of release, it had in fact been recorded in 1976 after their debut Below the Belt. It was also a posthumous release for band leader Mike Patto, who had died of cancer in March 1979, and for bass player Keith Ellis, who had died December 1978. Patto was credited as writer of all the album's original songs. Also featured were cover versions of &quot;Hey Bulldog&quot; by Lennon and McCartney, Leonard Cohen's &quot;Teachers&quot;, &quot;Dinah Low&quot; by Terry Stamp and Jim Avery (who also wrote &quot;Town Drunk&quot; on Boxer's debut album, &quot;Below The Belt&quot;) and &quot;The Loner&quot; by Neil Young. The cover artwork was by Tony Wright.\n\nBloodletting was released on CD in 2000 by EMI.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9143c3359c3b9fdc2e40244386a957fb44177586","amp;dn":"Boxer+-+Bloodletting+%5B1979%5D%5B2012%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9143c3359c3b9fdc2e40244386a957fb44177586","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,67,195,53,156,59,159,220,46,64,36,67,134,169,87,251,68,23,117,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
