Recorded in between sessions for Phil ManzaneraÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Diamond Head LP, Mainstream featured that guitaristÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s old band, reunited to finally create the album never made during the groupÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s original existence. Quiet Sun broke up in 1972 when Manzanera headed to Roxy Music, but the sessions for his solo album afforded the surreptitious opportunity to create this delightfully oddball album.\n\nBearing sonic similarities to Diamond Head ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ how could it not, using many of the same musicians, engineers and studio ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Mainstream is a far more unusual affair. Informed by the progressive jazz predilections of its band members ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ yet rooted in the distinctive textural playing of Manzanera ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the album sounds like little else of its era. Imagine if Caravan rocked (a lot) harder, and you begin to get a sense of this music.\n\nLargely dispensing both with vocals and pop song convention, the songs on Mainstream aim for the challenging end of the pool, and nearly always hit their mark. At times the songs feel improvised, and while tracks like ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSol CalienteÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ move in multiple directions at once, theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re carefully thought-out pieces. ManzaneraÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s guitar shrieks and screams while the band engages in some tricky, jazzy playing underneath. Like modern jazz, each playerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s part is inventive and worth individual attention. Like prog, thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s power and fury in much of the playing. Yet like rock, it, well, rocks.\n\nWhat Quiet Sun lacks ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and it lacks it in a good way ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ is any sort of pop sensibility. For that, listeners are directed to the excellent Diamond Head. But on Mainstream we get instead numbers like ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTrumpets With Motherhood,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ which sounds not unlike some sort of Carl Palmer-meets-Frank Zappa freakout. Then ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBargain ClassicsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ gets even weirder, with Manzanera turning in some of his strangest guitar work.\n\nQuiet Sun takes a more pensive approach on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œR.F.DÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ but even here thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a pleasantly unsettling vive; Dave JarrettÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s shimmering electric piano creates a moody ambience. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMummy Was an Asteroid, Daddy Was a Small Non-stick Kitchen UtensilÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is nowhere near as wacky as its title might suggest. Instead itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a guitar skronkfest with glittering Caravan-styled keyboard runs, all delivered in an aggressive Starless and Bible Black era King Crimson style.\n\nThe highlight of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTrotÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is a lovely piano solo from Jarrett. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRongwrongÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ has always been an oddity among oddities: it bears almost no similarity to a same-named track from the 801 Live album; that latter version has straightforward vocals (courtesy of Brian Eno), but the one on Mainstream is, like everything else on this difficult-yet-wonderful album ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ primarily instrumental. Here, when the vocals do appear, theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re quite different ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ both in content and delivery. TheyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re every bit as off-kilter as the rest of the sounds coming out of Mainstream.\n\nThe 2011 reissue of this oft-unavailable record is lovingly packaged in a hardcover case, making it look a bit like an old Hardy Boys or Nancy Drew book. Now released on ManzaneraÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s own Expression Records label, the reissue includes a detailed booklet complete with multiple essays, review reprints, photos and miscellany. Five bonus tracks add context; an early demo ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œYears of the Quiet SunÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ finds the band sounding a bit like very early King Crimson without the Mellotron and vocals. A modern-day recording of the band members reminiscing about the album and sessions wraps the package up nicely, finally telling the Quiet Sun Mainstream story as it deserves to be told.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nQuiet Sun - Mainstream (1976)\n2011 remaster + bonus tracks\n\nMP3 320kbps\n\nTracklist:\n\n1.
