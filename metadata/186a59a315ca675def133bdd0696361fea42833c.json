And although they paid Moscow a visit almost every tour within the aforementioned period there was always something that \nprevented me from attending their gigs Ã¢â‚¬â€œ be it money (and yes the prices for floor area @ DM shows in Moscow are insane if you ask me), time etc. This time around we purchased tix for 350 Eu for me and my wife 4-5 months \nin advance. \nDue to mal-organization (NO parking at all in the vicinity, huge line of people to one single tent with bracelets for 'fan-zone' area), we happened to enter the stadium building right @ the time the intro started, \nso it took me some time to pull out the mics/recorded/adjust those/adjust the sound.. So sorry to the completists (hi Vince ;)) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ this recording is not for you - it does not have the intro and half of the first song.  \nOther than that itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all there, almost without any talks from my neighbors (only in-between tracks). I tried my best to make the recording sound very good, though itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s evidently tad distant, has what one calls open air/arena \nsound (although without any wind obstruction). The sound might flow @ certain points Ã¢â‚¬â€œ sorry I had to take care of my wife due to pouring rain and sometimes I could not restrain myself from enjoying the gig. \n\nLast but not least Ã¢â‚¬â€œ I know this would be snatched a lot and people would never care to say thank you or maybe even comment on the quality and what theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d do remastering-wise to make it sound better, but please remember that \nitÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all quite hard labor/effort buy tix/tape the gig motionlessly/master/torrent itÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ I remember how eager i was to tape every more-or-less large band that was coming here back in mid 2000s, but due to calm leechers the enthusiasm \nis long gone. (Have you seen Bargest here much lately?) Yeah, why put it here if people start bitching about it/leech&amp;run ... If it were not for the tapers, live recordings would only be official (most likely studio re-mixed).\nEnjoy!\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\nCD 1:\t\n\n- Intro /missing/\n1.\tWelcome to My World /fades in/\n2.\tAngel \n3.\tWalking in My Shoes \n4.\tPrecious \n5.\tBlack Celebration \n6.\tPolicy of Truth \n7.\tShould Be Higher \n8.\tBarrel of a Gun \n9.\tHigher Love (Sung by Martin)\n10.\tBut Not Tonight (Acoustic; Sung by Martin)\n11.\tHeaven \n12.\tSoothe My Soul \n13.\tA Pain That I'm Used To ('Jacques Lu Cont's Remix' version)\n14.\tA Question of Time \n15.\tSecret to the End \n\n\nCD 2:\t\n\n1.\tEnjoy the Silence \n2.\tPersonal Jesus \n3.\tGoodbye \nEncore:\n4.\tHome (Acoustic)\n5.\tHalo ('Goldfrapp Remix' version)\n6.\tJust Can't Get Enough \n7.\tI Feel You \n8.\tNever Let Me Down Again\n\nP.S.
