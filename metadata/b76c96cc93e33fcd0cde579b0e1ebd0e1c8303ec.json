Pakula for their collaborative masterpiece: To Kill A Mockingbird (1962). \n\nI could've uploaded the entire movie along with the commentary but owing to I having a limited bandwidth &amp; my assumption that everybody owns a copy of the movie, I'm doing this.\n\nIt's an MPEG-4 AAC audio file (2 hours 9 minutes 12 seconds) which has been ripped from a R1-US-DVD9.\n\nAll you have to do is mux this audio file with your own copy of the movie which better be a decent BluRay Rip or DVD Rip to allow proper audio sync.\n\nAnd seed as much as you can.\n\nEnjoy!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b76c96cc93e33fcd0cde579b0e1ebd0e1c8303ec","amp;dn":"To+Kill+A+Mockingbird+1962+Commentary+by+director+%26amp%3B+producer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b76c96cc93e33fcd0cde579b0e1ebd0e1c8303ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,108,150,204,147,227,63,205,12,222,87,155,14,30,189,14,28,131,3,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
