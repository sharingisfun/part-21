Good Bait\n2. I Want To Talk About You\n3. You Say You Care\n4. Theme For Ernie\n5. Russian Lullaby\n\n\nRecorded in Hackensack, NJ on February 7, 1958\n\n\nPersonnel:\nJohn Coltrane - tenor saxophone\nRed Garland - piano\nPaul Chambers - bass\nArt Taylor - drums\n\n\nSoultrane, made right after the tenor player rejoined Miles Davis's group and three days after a session for the Milestones album, features the trumpeter's rhythm section of Red Garland, Paul Chambers and Art Taylor. Coltrane and Garland are especially compatible.\n \nThe mode is still strongly bop-oriented, with none of Coltrane's originals and the introduction of a favorite Coltrane theme, Billy Eckstine's &quot;I Want To Talk About You&quot; (revisited throughout the remainder of Coltrane's career). Also here are exceptionally good,  takes of Tadd Dameron's &quot;Good Bait,&quot; Irving Berlin's &quot;Russian Lullaby,&quot; the lovely &quot;Theme For Ernie&quot; and Jules Styne's &quot;You Say You Care.&quot; \n\nThe album is a showcase for Coltrane's late-1950s &quot;sheets of sound&quot; style, the term itself coined by critic Ira Gitler in the album's liner notes.\n\nFor a blowing date, though, it's hard to improve upon the appeal of this exceptionally fine session, alight as it is with some of the tenor's most assured and accessible playing. Highly enjoyable.\n\n\nStraight, no chaser.\n:)\n\n\n\n \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc7f8380e569af924ac3ea00a27ec2e0a6f3740d","amp;dn":"John+Coltrane+-+Soultrane+1958","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc7f8380e569af924ac3ea00a27ec2e0a6f3740d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,127,131,128,229,105,175,146,74,195,234,0,162,126,194,224,166,243,116,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
