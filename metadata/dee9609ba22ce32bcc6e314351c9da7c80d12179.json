The book also includes an overview of each type of structure, including above-ground and in-ground swimming pools, stand-alone whirlpools, integrated pool/spa installations, and pool houses and accessories. For readers who already own a pool or spa, lengthy, detailed chapters on basic maintenance, water quality, seasonal upkeep, and routine repairs provide everything needed to keep water features in good operating condition. Even the mechanical systems - pumps, heaters, drains and skimmers - are covered in depth. With this book, no pool or spa owner will need to spend money on a professional pool-care service, and may never need to call a repairman.\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dee9609ba22ce32bcc6e314351c9da7c80d12179","amp;dn":"Black+%26amp%3B+Decker+The+Complete+Guide%3A+Maintain+Your+Pool+%26amp%3B+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dee9609ba22ce32bcc6e314351c9da7c80d12179","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,233,96,155,162,44,227,43,204,110,49,67,81,201,218,124,128,209,33,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
