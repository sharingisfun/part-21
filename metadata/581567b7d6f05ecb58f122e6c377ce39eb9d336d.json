The film, based upon Durang's 1979 play Sister Mary Ignatius Explains It All For You, and starring Diane Keaton in the title role, premiered on the Showtime network.\n\nThe project was filmed in Toronto in association with Columbia TriStar Television. The theme was originally covered in Christopher Durang controversial 1979 stage play. In updating the character of Sister Mary, Durang read through 15 earlier drafts of the screenplay and discussed changes with Brickman and the producers. The original film title was Sister Mary, but Durang felt the proffered title was too generic, preferring the original theatrical title. For the film, Keaton was Brickman's choice for the role, which was cast against type, and she accepted the part because she thought she couldn't do it.\nThe Catholic League objected to the depiction of Catholicism in the film and took out a full-page advertisement in Variety to protest its broadcast. William A. Donohue, the president of the Catholic League, called for a boycott of Viacom, Showtime's parent company.\n\nSister Mary (Diane Keaton) is an authoritarian Catholic nun who teaches children. Her teaching is heavily influenced by her fanatical beliefs. Four of her former pupils, Gary (Brian Benben), Aloysius (Wallace Langham), Angela (Laura San Giacomo) and Philomena (Jennifer Tilly), return to the school to show her how deeply her strict views on faith and sin have affected their lives.\n\nDiane Keaton as Sister Mary Ignatius\nBrian Benben as Gary Sullivan\nWallace Langham as Aloysius Benheim\nLaura San Giacomo as Angela DiMarco\nJennifer Tilly as Philomena Rostovich\nMax Morrow as Thomas\nMartin Mull as Skeptical Husband\nLinda Kash as Skeptical Husband's Wife\nVictoria Tennant as Bitter Divorcee\nJoanne Boland as Cynthia Johnson\nJon Davey as Tony Cardonelli\nJoan Gregson as Deaf Woman\nMichael Cameron as Young Gary\nSteven Taylor as King Herod\nMark Allan as Attractive Man\nGary Pearson as Man in Audience\nJocelyne Zucco as Mrs. Cardonelli","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:581567b7d6f05ecb58f122e6c377ce39eb9d336d","amp;dn":"Sister+Mary+Explains+It+All+%282001%29+.x264+%7BDiane+Keaton%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"581567b7d6f05ecb58f122e6c377ce39eb9d336d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,21,103,183,214,240,94,203,88,241,34,230,195,119,206,57,235,157,51,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
