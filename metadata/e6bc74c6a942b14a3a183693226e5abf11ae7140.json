As the JJK crew continues to expand, several new out-of-this-world characters join the cast. Joan, Dennis, Irwin, Christa, and Brian are also forced to contend with a series of unexpected shocks and developments. Provocative, preposterous, and unflinchingly real, the new season boldly goes where no man, woman, or chihuahua has gone before. Only on AMC.\n\nSomeone's Got the Meatball (Pre-Air Premiere)\n Captain Starr creates a new training tape for JJK. Chief decides to capitalize on the Speecy Spicy Meatball. Irwin shows off his storage room.\n\nReleased May 06, 2014","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6bc74c6a942b14a3a183693226e5abf11ae7140","amp;dn":"Small+Town+Security+S03E01+Someones+Got+the+Meatball+Pre-Air+Pre","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6bc74c6a942b14a3a183693226e5abf11ae7140","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,188,116,198,169,66,177,74,58,24,54,147,34,110,90,191,17,174,113,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
