But as much more than just a strategy game, players directly participate in the action-packed combat with their hero characters, while upgrading their statistics, gathering tons of loot and inventory items, customizing &amp; upgrading equipment, and developing unique class abilities. All of this can be enjoyed in seamless online and split-screen local multiplayer, as players cooperate and compete through the story campaign and challenge missions to build the strongest heroes and achieve the highest scores in the kingdom.\n\nCombining the depth of strategic gaming with the satisfying action of RPG character building, in a beautifully stylized Ã¢â‚¬Ëœtoon fantasy setting, Dungeon Defenders is designed to be a distinctly addictive, easy-to-play experience for casual and hardcore gamers alike!\n\nUnzip, Move to Applications and Enjoy..\n\n\nSeed you bastards.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e68598566e983f8fe49ceb10c26936f200a07f9","amp;dn":"Dungeon+Defenders+for+Mac+%28NATIVE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e68598566e983f8fe49ceb10c26936f200a07f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,104,89,133,102,233,131,248,254,73,206,177,12,38,147,111,32,10,7,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
