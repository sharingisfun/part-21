He was working in the Gothenburg docks when he joined Nynningen, a rock group with leftist political texts and inspired by the Russian Communist poet Mayakovsky. Totta NÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤slund became the group's main singer.\nIn the mid-1970s, Nynningen fused with Nationalteatern, a musical theater ensemble with many members. Totta NÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤slund joined the group as singer, guitar-player and actor. Nationalteatern developed away from the theater and became a straight rock group, a rock orchestra as they called themselves. Even though Totta never wrote any own songs for the band, he was probably the most prominent member, next to Ulf Dageby.\nNationalteatern was one of the many leftist music and theater groups that came together in 1977 to form TÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤ltprojektet, The Tent Project, a musical theater performance on the history of the Swedish working class, which toured the country that summer. Totta NÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤slund played the Beggar, the central story telling character of the play, and he sang some of the lead songs, like Aldrig mera krig (Never War Again) and Vi ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤ro tusenden (We are legion). TÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤ltprojekted, a non-profit making experiment financed by its members and supporters, was highly successful.\nIn the beginning of the 1980s, Nationalteatern dissolved and Totta NÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤slund directed his full energy to his hobby project, Totta's Bluesband with lyrics in English and several smaller tours in the U.S..\nIn 1995, when Totta turned 50 years old, he decided to go for a solo career and has released 8 solo albums with mostly songs written directly for him by other artists, or covers of other songs.\nOne of Totta NÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤slund's main sources for inspirations was Bob Dylan, and in May 2005 he went to Dylan's hometown Hibbing, Minnesota despite his lethal cancer, where he performed his own interpretation of Bob Dylan songs. Totta had also started making an album together with Mikael Wiehe, with Dylan songs translated to Swedish, but this was interrupted when he suddenly died.\nTotta NÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤slund died June 19, 2005 of liver cancer. He was scheduled to perform in his hometown KÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶pmanholmen the next day. He was 60 years old.\n\nErik Torsten &quot;Totta&quot; NÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤slund, fÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶dd 1 april 1945 i Sandviken, dÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶d 19 juni 2005 i GÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶teborg, var en svensk musiker och skÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥despelare.\nNÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤slund vÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤xte upp i KÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶pmanholmen och bosatte sig 1970 i GÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶teborg. Han uppmÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤rksammades som musiker under progg-vÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥gen, dÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥ han var med fÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rst i Nynningen och sedan i Nationalteatern. Han var ocksÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥ en av frontfigurerna i TÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤ltprojektet. Sedan proggen dÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶tt ut har han bland annat varit verksam som bluesartist i Tottas bluesband. Sin stora berÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶mmelse bland de breda folklagren fick Totta med sina soloskivor som gjordes efter 1995.\nHan avled 2005 pÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥ ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€œstra sjukhuset i GÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶teborg, efter en lÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥ng tids sjukdom i cancer, kort efter en sista turnÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© till Hibbing, Minnesota. Det var i Hibbing Bob Dylan vÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤xte upp frÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥n sju ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥rs ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥lder. NÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤slunds sista inspelade skiva blev Dylan, ett album med tolkningar av Bob Dylan pÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥ svenska som han spelade in tillsammans med Mikael Wiehe och som gavs ut postumt 2006.\n2006 gavs hyllningsalbumet Bra dagar - en skiva till Totta ut, med medverkan frÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥n artister som Plura, Jenny Silver, Tomas Andersson Wij, Mikael Wiehe och Nisse Hellberg.\n\n\nHan fattas oss\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0aa8fcfbe284e05b3423e6dee05440b6578d9dc4","amp;dn":"Totta+N%C3%A4slund+album","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0aa8fcfbe284e05b3423e6dee05440b6578d9dc4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,168,252,251,226,132,224,91,52,35,230,222,224,84,64,182,87,141,157,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
