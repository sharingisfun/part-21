Democracy Now!'s War and Peace Report provides the audience with access to people and perspectives rarely heard in the U.S.corporate-sponsored media, including independent and international journalists, ordinary people from around the world who are directly affected by U.S. foreign policy, grassroots leaders and peace activists, artists, academics and independent analysts. In addition, Democracy Now! hosts real debatesâ€“debates between people who substantially disagree, such as between the White House or the Pentagon spokespeople on the one hand, and grassroots activists on the other.\r\n\r\nDemocracy Now!\r\nWednesday, June 01, 2016\r\n\r\nAs 1,000 Refugees Drown Under European Policies, Meet the Volunteers Who Are Trying to Save Lives\r\n\r\nOAS Threatens to Suspend Venezuela While Ignoring Recent Ouster of Brazilâ€™s Dilma Rousseff\r\n\r\nIn Wake of Coup, Should Brazilâ€™s Olympics Be Moved or Become a Site of Protest?\r\n\r\nSupport independent news! \nhttp://www.democracynow.org","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d2f158b90bf78e04c3042c30f9e3bf7201659358","amp;dn":"Democracy+Now%21+2016-06-01+-+Refugee+Crisis%2C+Venezuela%2C+Brazil","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d2f158b90bf78e04c3042c30f9e3bf7201659358","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,241,88,185,11,247,142,4,195,4,44,48,249,227,191,114,1,101,147,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
