At their core, Green Day were simply punk revivalists who recharged the energy of speedy, catchy three-chord punk-pop songs. Though their music wasn't particularly innovative, they brought the sound of late-'70s punk to a new, younger generation with Dookie, their 1994 major-label debut. Dookie sold over ten million copies, paving the way for a string of multi-platinum releases that opened the doors for a flood of American neo-punk, punk metal, and third wave ska revivalists. More than a decade later, as many of their former contemporaries settled into retirement, Green Day remained at the forefront of popular music with albums like the Grammy-winning American Idiot.\n\n\n+--------+\n| Artist | : Alternative\n+--------+\n\n+---------------+\n| Studio Albums |\n+---------------+\n\n1,039 Smoothed Out Slappy Hours (1990)\nKerplunk (1992)\nDookie (1994)\nInsomniac (1995)\nNimrod (1997)\nWarning (2000)\nAmerican Idiot (2004)\n21st Century Breakdown (2009)\n\n\n+----------+\n| Settings |\n+----------+\n\nContent: Parental Advisory (EXPLICIT)\nCopyright: theLEAK\nEncoded by: theLEAK\nCountry: USA\nFull information: https://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=97572&amp;pid=675450#pid675450","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6eb52bbb9ec38f8415bd31c4f9c308978747747","amp;dn":"Green+Day+Studio+Discography+%28iTunes+Edition%29+%5BtheLEAK%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c6eb52bbb9ec38f8415bd31c4f9c308978747747","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,235,82,187,185,236,56,248,65,91,211,28,79,156,48,137,120,116,119,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
