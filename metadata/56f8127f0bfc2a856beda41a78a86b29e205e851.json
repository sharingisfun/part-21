The dogs were gone. Now Mawson himself plunged through a snow bridge, dangling over an abyss by the sledge harness. A line of poetry gave him the will to haul himself back to the surface.\n\nMawson was sometimes reduced to crawling, and one night he discovered that the soles of his feet had completely detached from the flesh beneath. On February 8, when he staggered back to base, his features unrecognizably skeletal, the first teammate to reach him blurted out, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Which one are you?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThis thrilling and almost unbelievable account establishes Mawson in his rightful place as one of the greatest polar explorers and expedition leaders. It is illustrated by a trove of Frank HurleyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s famous Antarctic photographs, many never before published in the United States. 24 pages of illustrations\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56f8127f0bfc2a856beda41a78a86b29e205e851","amp;dn":"Alone+on+the+Ice%3A+The+Greatest+Survival+Story+in+the+History+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56f8127f0bfc2a856beda41a78a86b29e205e851","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,248,18,127,11,252,42,133,107,237,164,26,120,168,107,41,226,5,232,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
