It disables copy protection and region coding, so you can play just about any DVD on a PC and run a copying program to make a backup.\r\n\r\nWhat AnyDVD HD doesn't do is copy the DVD â€“ for that you'll need a separate DVD copy application, like Nero or Slysoft's own CloneDVD. AnyDVD HD sits in the background and enables you to run whatever playback or backup software you want, just as if it's an unprotected DVD.\r\n\r\nThe usual caveat applies to this software, that copying a commercial movie DVD infringes the movie producer's intellectual property and may well be an offence. There are a few legitimate reasons why you might want to make a copy of a DVD, though.\r\n\r\nThe first is for backup, as it's not that difficult to scratch a DVD and make it unplayable. Backing up a legitimately purchased DVD for your own security is a grey area, but as long as you don't sell on the original or the copy, it's unlikely you'll have FAST at your door.\r\n\r\nYou could also have been living abroad and have built up a collection of DVD movies from a different coding region. Assuming you can't continue to use the playback equipment you used when you were abroad, it seems reasonable to want to make copies of your movies with the new region code, when you return home.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n\r\n- Install AnyDVD, reboot.\r\n- If opened already, close it from tray.\r\n- Double click on the HD key.
