It provides a succinct presentation of the material so that the students more easily understand the more difficult concepts. Many thermodynamics texts are over 900 pages long and it is often difficult to ferret out the essentials due to the excessive verbiage. This book presents those essentials.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6638a53eb38ac47c3791d50fee89bf1b8a3d074","amp;dn":"McGraw+Hill+-+Thermodynamics+Demystified+%5Banno19%5D.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6638a53eb38ac47c3791d50fee89bf1b8a3d074","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,99,138,83,235,56,172,71,195,121,29,80,254,232,155,241,184,163,208,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
