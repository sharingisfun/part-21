I will\nbegin the article by giving a very brief overview of the capabilities approach, and\nthen explain how Nussbaum has extended it to include nonhuman animals. I will\nthen argue that there are currently three main philosophical problems with the\ntheory that need further attention. I will end by proposing a way to deal with these problems, and by showing how the capabilities approach has the potential to affect changes in public policy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:acf512dd56752e26ec2d0a3a696aa95203b365ba","amp;dn":"Nussbaum%C3%A2%E2%82%AC%E2%84%A2s+Capabilities+Approach+and+Nonhuman+Animals%3A+Theory+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"acf512dd56752e26ec2d0a3a696aa95203b365ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,245,18,221,86,117,46,38,236,45,10,58,105,106,169,82,3,179,101,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
