Crowe plays Australian farmer Joshua Connor, who, in 1919, goes in search of his three missing sons, last known to have fought against the Turks in the bloody Battle of Gallipoli. Arriving in Istanbul, he is thrust into a vastly different world, where he encounters others who suffered their own losses in the conflict: Ayshe (Olga Kurylenko), a strikingly beautiful but guarded hotelier raising a child alone; her young, spirited son, Orhan (Dylan Georgiades), who finds a friend in Connor; and Major Hasan (Yilmaz ErdoÃ„Å¸an), a Turkish officer who fought against ConnorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s boys and may be this fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s only hope. With seemingly insurmountable obstacles in his path, Connor must travel across the battle-scarred Turkish landscape to find the truthÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ and his own peace.\n\nDirector: Russell Crowe\n\nWriters: Andrew Knight, Andrew Anastasios\n\nActors: Russell Crowe, Olga Kurylenko, Yilmaz Erdogan, Cem Yilmaz, Jai Courtney, Ryan Corr, James Fraser, Ben O'Toole, Isabel Lucas\n\nGenre: Drama","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79132fff7fb74b2d181adad99d70d7ddee48904c","amp;dn":"The+Water+Diviner.+Official+Featurette+%5BHD%5D+%282015%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79132fff7fb74b2d181adad99d70d7ddee48904c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,19,47,255,127,183,75,45,24,26,218,217,157,112,215,221,238,72,144,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
