Allison Hayes achieved screen immortality as Nancy Archer, the wealthy, dipsomaniac wife of shameless philanderer Harry Archer (William Hudson). When she witnesses the crash landing of a alien spaceship -- whose occupant is a 30-foot giant, dressed in the manner of a medieval Frenchmen! -- Nancy goes to the local sheriff (George Douglas) with her story, only to be laughed off as a drunken crank. Even the local TV anchorman makes cruel fun of Nancy on his nightly newscast. Meanwhile, hubby Harry is making whoopee at a roadhouse with his latest tootsie, Honey Parker (Yvette Vickers). Not long afterward, Nancy, who's been exposed to the radiation of the spaceship, begins to feel queasy. Within a few days, she has grown to the height of 50 feet and is lumbering around the countryside clad only in a gigantic towel, smashing houses and trees in search of her faithless husband (&quot;HARRY-HARRY!!!&quot;) Hilarious in its ineptitude (the special effects are particularly shoddy), Attack of the 50 Foot Woman  is impossible to dislike, which cannot be said of its slicker but less entertaining 1993 cable-TV remake (with Darryl Hannah in the title role). \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0051380/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0051380/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nSubs\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/sublanguageid-all/idmovie-30590&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/sublanguageid-all/idmovie-30590&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nDirector:\nNathan Juran\n\n\n\tAllison Hayes\t ... \tNancy Fowler Archer\n\tWilliam Hudson\t... \tHarry Archer\n\tYvette Vickers\t... \tHoney Parker\n\tRoy Gordon\t... \tDr. Isaac Cushing\n\tGeorge Douglas\t... \tSheriff Dubbitt\n\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:05:40\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 688x384 1,79:1\nCodec : XviD MPEG-4 codec\nFPS : 23,98\nBitRate : 1360 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,22 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 128 Kbps\n\nPlease seed at least as much as you D/L.\n=======================================\nThanks \n\nJohn","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27649cce9c91e90319a9cd5ae5fcdf9647c817d8","amp;dn":"Attack+of+the+50+Foot+Woman+%281958%29+Allison+Hayes+%28Eng%2CFr+hardsub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27649cce9c91e90319a9cd5ae5fcdf9647c817d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,100,156,206,156,145,233,3,25,169,205,90,229,252,223,150,71,200,23,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
