Only they might appreciate the storyline, let alone stand a chance against the beast that &quot;A Starcraft Odyssey&quot; is. \n\nThe story picks up after the events on &quot;Omega&quot;. That could mean some months, or most probably a couple of years after the events of Brood War (there is no strict time-frame). \nThe new campaigns find most of the characters from Brood War still alive and well, ready for a new circle of carnage!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:70a63320d6c55f672516c8b99a36abb187cf142b","amp;dn":"After+BroodWar+Campaigns+-+A+Starcraft+Odyssey.zip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"70a63320d6c55f672516c8b99a36abb187cf142b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,166,51,32,214,197,95,103,37,22,200,185,154,54,171,177,135,207,20,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
