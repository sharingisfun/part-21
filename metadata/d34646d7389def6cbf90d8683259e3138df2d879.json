Deschamps, J. Matschullat (CRC, 2011).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 978-0-203-09322-1\r\n\r\nThe discussion on arsenic in the environment is complex and must grasp the importance of very many, mostly unrelated works on individual aspects. This volume represents one of the first comprehensive and interdisciplinary examinations into arsenic's behaviour in air, water, soils, sediments, plants and the human body. Based on state-of-the-art investigations into the global arsenic cycle, the related human toxicology and available remediation technologies, arsenic is assessed holistically in all the environmental compartments. Using the results of primary research, the authors offer concrete suggestions for risk reduction and management of environmental pollution that allow the reader to successfully tackle similar problems and find sustainable solutions. The book consists of three essential parts:\r\n\r\nReview of the current knowledge of arsenic behaviour in the environment (global biogeochemical cycles), toxicology, remediation techniques, immobilization technologies and environmental legislation\r\n\r\nCase studies for mining-related arsenic problems\r\n\r\nDiscussion of mitigation and remediation technologies and approaches such as environmental education, hygiene training, backed by real experience and successful implementation in the study area\r\n\r\nIn a highly coherent manner, the book makes use of 120 tables and figures, a large number of literature citations, and very detailed subject index (that encompasses references) to provide rapid and up-to-date access to all relevant information. Cross-references provide a great manoeuvrability between the chapters.\r\n\r\nThe book delivers very insightful and hands-on approaches for graduate students and professionals working on arsenic questions not only in environmental science, but also in the fields of environmental engineering, medicine and social science","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d34646d7389def6cbf90d8683259e3138df2d879","amp;dn":"Arsenic+-+Natural+and+Anthropogenic","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d34646d7389def6cbf90d8683259e3138df2d879","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,70,70,215,56,157,239,108,191,144,216,104,50,89,227,19,141,242,216,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
