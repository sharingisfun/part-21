While on their mission, they clash with several younger, technology oriented action heroes.\n\nIn The Expendables 3, Barney (Sylvester Stallone), Christmas (Jason Statham) and the rest of the team comes face-to-face with Conrad Stonebanks (Mel Gibson), who years ago co-founded The Expendables with Barney. Stonebanks subsequently became a ruthless arms trader and someone who Barney was forced to killÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ or so he thought. Stonebanks, who eluded death once before, now is making it his mission to end The Expendables -- but Barney has other plans. Barney decides that he has to fight old blood with new blood, and brings in a new era of Expendables team members, recruiting individuals who are younger, faster and more tech-savvy. The latest mission becomes a clash of classic old-school style versus high-tech expertise in the ExpendablesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ most personal battle yet.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:903cf6ff6622d4ccb0c40d67a0ca94ace465c7a8","amp;dn":"The+Expendables+3+-+720p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"903cf6ff6622d4ccb0c40d67a0ca94ace465c7a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,60,246,255,102,34,212,204,176,196,13,103,160,202,148,172,228,101,199,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
