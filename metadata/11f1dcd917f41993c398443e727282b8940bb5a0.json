In keeping with my general policy, I will only be including half the available tracks on any given album, and encourage you to fill in the gaps by supporting the artists and purchasing the CD&amp;#039;s. Even so, this is a healthy dollop of period music!\n\nThis is all new material -- it is not included in any of my other medieval/hymnal  torrents. A good portion of Middle Eastern Christian music is included. In order, they are:\n\nA Star In The East (Anonymous 4)\nChants Byzantin (Sister Mary Keyrouz)\nChants Chretiens Arameens (Esther Lamandier)\nAn English Ladymass (Anonymous 4)\nHildegard von Bingen und ihre Zeit (Music fur fruhe Musik Augsberg)\nLutheran Mass For Christmas Morning (Gabrielle Consort &amp; Players)\nMedieval Christmas (Boston Camerata)\nPsallite!- A Renaissance Christmas (Boston Camerata)\nSing We Noel (Boston Camerata)\nThe Ancient Miracles (Music fur fruhe Musik Augsberg)\nVision (Richard Souther/Hildegard von Bingen) \n\nAll are high quality rips at 320 bps. Enjoy, and feel free to download my other torrents if you enjoy this fine old music -- and keep seeding!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:11f1dcd917f41993c398443e727282b8940bb5a0","amp;dn":"Religious+Music+Of+The+Middle+Ages","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"11f1dcd917f41993c398443e727282b8940bb5a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,241,220,217,23,244,25,147,195,152,68,62,114,114,130,184,148,11,181,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
