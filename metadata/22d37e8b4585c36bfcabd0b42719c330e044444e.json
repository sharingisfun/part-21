One of the subjects of interest was how to &quot;rescue&quot; music from the formalism and stilted expression that some at least perceived it to be in. The result was a new, monodic method of writing that owed a great deal to folk-popular use. Instrumentals achieved an originality they seldom had before, and instrumentalists began at least in some courts, churches and cities to receive salaries that previously had only been offered to vocalists.\r\n\r\nThis album focuses on instrumentals composed throughout the Italian courts and chapels of the early 17th century. Several of the composers were vital to the development of the traveling virtuoso, and borrowed a theatrical style from the newly formed operatic stage. The music they produced is unfailingly tuneful and varied.\r\n\r\nAll transfers are made at 768 kBits/s, directly from the disc.\r\n\r\nYou can find all my classical uploads by searching on Philidor, or just looking in this regularly updated thread:\r\n \nhttps://pirates-forum.org/Thread-Philidor-s-uploads--63895","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22d37e8b4585c36bfcabd0b42719c330e044444e","amp;dn":"Amours%2C+Zephyrs+%26amp%3B+Sirenes+-+La+Turbulente+%282002%29+%5BPhilidor%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22d37e8b4585c36bfcabd0b42719c330e044444e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,211,126,139,69,133,195,107,252,171,208,180,39,25,195,48,224,68,68,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
