Acclimating to his position, he encounters a schizophrenic who helps him to discover the book&amp;#039;s secrets and his place in the story. \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0418004/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0418004/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nCast \n\tAaron Eckhart\t... \tZach Riley\n\tIan McKellen\t... \tGabriel Finch\n\tBrittany Murphy\t... \tMaggie Blake\n\tNick Nolte\t... \tT.L.

Then you come out of the theatre wondering why everyone else you know hasn&amp;#039;t gone to see it yet. Ian McKellan and Aaron Eckhart both give strong performances easily pulling off the emotionalism needed for the movie, and throwing in enough humor to keep you interested. Nick Nolte, Jessica Lange, William Hurt, and Brittany Murphy all pull off great supporting roles without overshadowing the main actors. Alan Cumming, although his role is small, really pulls at the heart strings with his portrayal of a patient of the institution.\n\nBecause this movie has had little (if any) publicity, I think this movie will do well based on word of mouth alone. Definitely a &quot;hidden gem&quot;.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74e6e86050aafba76e757f03b01afa5f0b77de82","amp;dn":"Neverwas+2005+DVDRip+XviD-ViLLAiN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74e6e86050aafba76e757f03b01afa5f0b77de82","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,230,232,96,80,170,251,167,110,117,127,3,176,26,250,95,11,119,222,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
