MY FAVORITE THINGS: COLTRANE AT NEWPORT brings together performances from two of the legendary saxophonist's appearances at the Newport Jazz Festival: one from 1963 and the other from 1965.\n\nColtrane performs here with his classic quartet: bassist Jimmy Garrison, pianist McCoy Tyner, and drummer Elvin Jones. On the '63 date, Roy Haynes sits in for Jones, and Haynes's effect on the music (he has a lighter touch and is more of a colorist) will strike the ear of those who know this period of Coltrane well. Another stand-out quality is the extended jam on &quot;Impressions&quot;, released here for the first time in its entirety.\n\n01.  \tI Want To Talk About You (1963 Newport Jazz Festival)\t9:41 \n02. \tMy Favorite Things (1963 Newport Jazz Festival 17:20\n03. \tImpressions (1963 Newport Jazz Festival) 23:30\n\nJohn Coltrane (soprano and tenor saxophones); McCoy Tyner (piano); Jimmy Garrison (bass); Roy Haynes (drums)\nRecorded on July 7, 1963, Newport Jazz Festival, Newport, Rhode Island\n\n04. \tSpoken Introduction By Father Norman O'Connor (1965 Newport Jazz Festival) 1:08\n05. \tOne Down, One Up (1965 Newport Jazz Festival) 12:42\n06. \tMy Favorite Things (1965 Newport Jazz Festival) 15:14\n\nJohn Coltrane (soprano and tenor saxophones); McCoy Tyner (piano); Jimmy Garrison (bass); Elvin Jones (drums)\nRecorded on July 2, 1965, Newport Jazz Festival, Newport, Rhode Island\n\nRipped using MAX (http://sbooth.org/Max/); Cue sheet is embedded in FLAC file\n\nFLAC settings: exhaustiveModelSearch:0 midSideStereo:1 looseMidSideStereo:0 QLPCoeffPrecision:0, ,enableQLPCoeffPrecisionSearch:0, minResidualPartitionOrder:0, maxResidualPartitionOrder:5, maxLPCOrder:8, apodization:tukey(0.5)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9742508d22007ebb4fa9acdf63285dc7b7df823a","amp;dn":"John+Coltrane+-+My+Favorite+Things+-+Coltrane+At+Newport+%5BFLAC%5D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9742508d22007ebb4fa9acdf63285dc7b7df823a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,66,80,141,34,0,126,187,79,169,172,223,99,40,93,199,183,223,130,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
