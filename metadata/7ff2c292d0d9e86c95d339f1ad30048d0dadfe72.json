He champions loudness in the opening Ã¢â‚¬Å“Turn It UpÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ by singing about blasting Waylon Jennings in his truck, cranking the volume on his guitar amps, and embracing the rock Ã¢â‚¬ËœnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ roll adage that if itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s too loud, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re too old. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Something to Believe InÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ works in more pedal steel and vintage organ tones as Creager croons longingly for something worthy of belief in a jaded era of misinformation. For anyone who ever loved the drama of Miranda LambertÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s breakup songs, CreagerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dead LoveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ offers a perspective from the side of a guy with a crazy ex-girlfriend (check the blistering-hot Telecaster solo at the tune's end). Ã¢â‚¬Å“If You Really Love MeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ slows down to reveal the manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s notable prowess as a tear-in-beer balladeer, before Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bad Friend to a Good ManÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ showcases his knack for the kind of narrative that makes so many country songs rich with stories for the American everyman. The heartfelt, honky-tonking title track closes on a more autobiographical note.\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n01. Turn It Up (03:07), 7.23 MB\n02. Something To Believe In (03:23), 7.84 MB\n03.
