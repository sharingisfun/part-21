Confucianism originated as an &quot;ethical-sociopolitical teaching&quot; during the Spring and Autumn Period, but later developed metaphysical and cosmological elements in the Han Dynasty.[1] Following the official abandonment of Legalism in China after the Qin Dynasty, Confucianism became the official state ideology of the Han. Nonetheless, since the Han period onward, most Chinese emperors used a mix of Legalism and Confucianism as their ruling doctrine, often with the latter embellishing the former. In other words, Confucian values were used to sugarcoat the harsh Legalist ideas that underlie the Imperial system. The disintegration of the Han in the second century CE opened the way for the spiritual and otherworldly doctrines of Buddhism and Daoism to dominate intellectual life at that time.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:99d53b56c933643ae5419e20a4be0b316b738300","amp;dn":"Confucian+Classics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"99d53b56c933643ae5419e20a4be0b316b738300","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,213,59,86,201,51,100,58,229,65,158,32,164,190,11,49,107,115,131,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
