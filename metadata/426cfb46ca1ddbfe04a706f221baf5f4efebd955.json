A compelling story of dictatorship, bloody battles, and endless courage as the Soviet people combat not only Hitler and the Germany Army, but their own leader as well. Hosted by former US Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, this 10-hour program features never-before-seen Russian images, once-secret documents, and leading Russian historians to explore Russia from 1924 through 1953.\n\nVol. 1: The Darkness Descends\n\nLenin dies and leaves behind a power struggle for the leadership of the Soviet empire. He also leaves a testament--a fatal warning against Stalin's ambition. Nevertheless, Stalin rises to power and begins his war against the Soviet people an assault on the peasantry and mysterious assassination of political rivals and on the eve of the war with Germany, his disastrous purge of the Red Army.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:426cfb46ca1ddbfe04a706f221baf5f4efebd955","amp;dn":"Russia%5C%27s+War%3A+Blood+Upon+the+Snow+++%28Part+1%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"426cfb46ca1ddbfe04a706f221baf5f4efebd955","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,108,251,70,202,29,219,254,4,167,6,242,33,186,245,244,239,235,217,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
