I don't like .NFO files, so I try not to write any of it. I hate 2 CD's for a movie, it's like watching 2 episodes from TV series. So I took the 2CD's of ARROW's release and put it in a single video file. Didn't touch the quality. Sample provided too.\n\nThe film is a sequel to ZombieÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s 2007 remake of Halloween (1978), and the tenth film in the Halloween film series.
