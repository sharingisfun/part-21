(2009)\n\nLiving in interesting timesÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nJack Vance has long been one of the most influential, admired and imitated writers in science fiction and fantasy literature, the award-winning author of such widely acclaimed works as The Dying Earth, the Lyonesse trilogy, the adventures of Cugel the Clever, the Demon Princes series, and many other masterful tales set among the stars, in exotic fantasy realms or on our own Earth.\n\nFor much of his career, Vance has also been one of the field's most private writers, an author who preferred to let his work speak for him. Now, at last, to coincide with the release of the tribute anthology Songs of the Dying Earth, Jack gives us this intimate and fascinating glimpse into his rich and eventful life, and a valuable insight into how he went about practicing his craft.\n\nFor fans of the Grand Master's work, these memoirs are something to be treasured.\n\nEPUB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e10fb3ed4dfa4206ad48d9df325464583c82cff1","amp;dn":"Jack+Vance+-+This+is+me%2C+Jack+Vance%21+%282009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e10fb3ed4dfa4206ad48d9df325464583c82cff1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,15,179,237,77,250,66,6,173,72,217,223,50,84,100,88,60,130,207,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
