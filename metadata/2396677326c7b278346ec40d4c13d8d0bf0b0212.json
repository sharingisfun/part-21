Amidst an extended, segmented David Bowie, they jumped to\nthe 1st known public performance of Lullaby Of Birdland, then to TreyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s explanation of the Phish Secret Language Instructions and back. The show was cut short when plumbing problems in the theater Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a leak in an upper bathroom Ã¢â‚¬â€œ caused a flood at the dancefloor and stage below. Trey promised the audience that the band would Ã¢â‚¬Å“make it up to you next timeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (see 2/19/93 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2/21/93). Undaunted by the fear of electrocution, the rowdy crowd down front some of whom were standing in ankle-deep sewer water, chanted Ã¢â‚¬Å“Zap us, Zap us!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Due to the flood, all of Ã¢â‚¬Å“set IIÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ was performed entirely without microphones. Before I DidnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Know, in response to a number of yelled requests, Fish sang the opening to Avenu Malcanu. Unable to play his vacuum powered bagpipes solo, Fish complained loudly during I DidnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Know that Ã¢â‚¬Å“they just turned off the stage power off right at this crucial moment of my life.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ He made it up by playing some trombone for the rest of the song. The only known surviving recording of this show was Bryon SosinskiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s audience tape, which was professionally remastered to create the Ã¢â‚¬Å“March 28, 1992 Variety Playhouse Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Atlanta, GAÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Phish DryGoods bonus CD that accompanied the Ã¢â‚¬Å“At The RoxyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ CD boxed set.\n\n03/28/1992\tVariety Playhouse, Atlanta, GA\n\nSet 1: Runaway Jim, Foam, Sparkle, Stash, Rift, Bouncing Around the Room, The Landlady &gt; David Bowie -&gt; Lullaby of Birdland[1] &gt; David Bowie &gt; Secret Language Instructions[2] &gt; David Bowie[3], Glide &gt; Cavern\n\nSet 2: Memories[4], Carolina[4], I Didn't Know[5], Sweet Adeline[4]\n\n[1] Phish debut.\n[2] Simpsons, Random Note, Turn Turn Turn, and All Fall Down signals introduced.\n[3] Simpsons signal.\n[4] Without microphones.\n[5] Without microphones; Fishman on trombone.\n\nNotes: This show featured the Phish debut of Lullaby of Birdland.
