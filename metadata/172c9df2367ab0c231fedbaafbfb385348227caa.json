Max (Tom Hardy), a survivor in Australia, is captured by the War Boys, the army of tyrannical cult leader King Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne). Designated a universal blood donor, Max is imprisoned and used as a blood bag for the sick War Boy Nux (Nicholas Hoult). Meanwhile, Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) drives her heavily-armored War Rig to collect gasoline. Furiosa begins driving off route, alerting Joe who realizes that his Five Wives Ã¢â‚¬â€ women specially selected for breeding Ã¢â‚¬â€ are gone. Joe leads his entire War Boy army in pursuit of Furiosa, calling on the aid of nearby Gas Town and the Bullet Farm.\n\nNux joins the army with Max strapped to the hood of his car, to continue supplying blood. A battle ensues between the Rig and Joe's forces. Furiosa drives into an approaching sand storm evading her pursuers, except Nux, who attempts to sacrifice himself to destroy the Rig; Max escapes and restrains Nux, but the car is destroyed by the Rig. Waking up after the storm, Max sees Furiosa nearby repairing her Rig, accompanied by the Wives: Angharad, Capable, Cheedo, Toast, and the Dag. Max steals the Rig, but its kill-switch disables the truck. Max reluctantly agrees to let Furiosa and the Wives accompany him, while Nux returns to Joe.\n\n\n\nnote : 2 hours work and no logos on the screen during the movie view\n\n\n\nenjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:172c9df2367ab0c231fedbaafbfb385348227caa","amp;dn":"Mad+Max+4+-+Fury+Road+-+NoLogos+-CamRip.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"172c9df2367ab0c231fedbaafbfb385348227caa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,44,157,242,54,122,176,194,49,254,219,170,251,251,56,83,72,34,124,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
