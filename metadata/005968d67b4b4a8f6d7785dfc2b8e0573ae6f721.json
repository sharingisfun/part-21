Lossless FLAC encoding.\n\n- The in-game volume was set to 8, the highest clip-free level for these songs.\n\n- Why 48 kHz?  Because that's what comes out.\n\n- There are a few small problems.  They were all triple-checked.  This is exactly what the game puts out.\n\n- Same lengths of silent padding (at the beginning and end of each track) as on the CD.\n\n- This is probably as pure and clean as a recording from an Xbox 360 gets :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:005968d67b4b4a8f6d7785dfc2b8e0573ae6f721","amp;dn":"Metallica+-+Death+Magnetic+%28perfect+FLAC+recordings+from+GH3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"005968d67b4b4a8f6d7785dfc2b8e0573ae6f721","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,89,104,214,123,75,74,143,109,119,133,223,194,184,224,87,58,230,247,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
