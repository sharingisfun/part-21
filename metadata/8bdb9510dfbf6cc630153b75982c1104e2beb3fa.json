They would     \n  also abolish political power and create a new kind of democracy       \n  through the internet where millions of individuals would be           \n  connected as nodes in cybernetic systems  without hierarchy.

They saw themselves as a prototype for a future society    \n  where everyone could follow their own selfish desires. The other is   \n  the global utopia that digital entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley set    \n  out to create in the 1990s. They were joined by Alan Greenspan who    \n  became convinced that the computers were creating a new kind of       \n  stable capitalism  Like a new planet, he said. But the dream of    \n  stability in both worlds would be torn apart by two dynamic human     \n  forces: love and power.                                               \n                                                                        \n &lt;a href=&quot; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Watched_Over_by_Machines_of_Loving_&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Watched_Over_by_Machines_of_Loving_&lt;/a&gt;  \n                                                                        \n  Grace_%28television_documentary_series%29                             \n                                                                        \n &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b011lvb9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b011lvb9&lt;/a&gt;                              \n                                                                        \n \n\n  WE'RE LOOKiNG FOR \n                                                   \n                                                                        \n  * Broadcast/Network/PPV TV Cappers with English PDTV/HDTV sources     \n     located in the US/UK/AU/CA/EU                                      \n  * People with PDTV/HDTV sources with an interest in capping           \n  * Pre-retail/unreleased DVD Suppliers (especially sports)             \n  * 100mbit+ affil sites with archives                                  \n                                                                        \n   Find us or email &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;8ef9bae8edfcebf9cee9e3efe7e2a0ede1e3&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; if you can help                   \n                                                                        \n \n\n  GREETZ \n                                                              \n                                                                        \n   To all W4F/CLASSiCW4F members, both past and present. :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8bdb9510dfbf6cc630153b75982c1104e2beb3fa","amp;dn":"All.Watched.Over.By.Machines.Of.Loving.Grace.Part1.WS.PDTV.XviD-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8bdb9510dfbf6cc630153b75982c1104e2beb3fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,219,149,16,223,191,108,198,48,21,59,117,152,44,17,4,226,190,179,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
