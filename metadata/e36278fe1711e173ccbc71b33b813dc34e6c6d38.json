At New York's underfunded and (mostly) secret Department of Extraordinary Affairs, he's learning about red tape, office politics, and the basics of paranormal investigation. But it's not the paperwork that has him breathless.\n\nAfter Simon spills his coffee on (okay, through) the ghost of a beautiful woman- who doesn't know she's dead-he and his mentor plan to find her killers. But Simon's not prepared for the nefarious plot that unfolds before him, involving politically correct cultists, a large wooden fish, a homicidal bookcase, and the forces of Darkness, which kind of have a crush on him.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e36278fe1711e173ccbc71b33b813dc34e6c6d38","amp;dn":"Simon+Canderous+%28Books+1+-+3%29+by+Anton+Strout","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e36278fe1711e173ccbc71b33b813dc34e6c6d38","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,98,120,254,23,17,225,115,204,188,113,179,59,129,61,195,78,108,109,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
