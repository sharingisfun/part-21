I noticed there are another 2 torrents of Seasons 1-2 with a bigger file size per episode (mislabeled as 'Auf Weidersehen Pet'). No point of me doing it again, eh? I assume that the other torrents have only  the non-English bits as burnt-in subtitles, since English is listed as a subtitle language, but there are no external subs.\n\n******* AUF WIEDERSEHEN, PET **********\n\nIMDb User Rating: 8.6/10  (580 votes)\n\nPlot Summary:\n\nThe adventures of a gang of British workmen abroad. Combines black and white humour with moments of drama, poignancy and drunkenness. The gang are reunited for a second series, in which they travel to Wolverhampton to rebuild both the &quot;magnificent seven&quot; and Barry's home for his impending marriage. A further offer of work sees the lads head to a Derbyshire stately home in need of refurbishment. Here they fall foul of an irritable pub landlord, suspicious locals, a less than enlightened employer and the Inland Revenue. Finally, they are packed off to Spain as illegal workers for Tyneside villain Ally Fraser, and they fall under the unwelcome spotlight of tabloid publicity. Despite this, they still manage to indulge in some serious drinking practice AND complete the building work.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7aa88f885c1e20b3073b9fb322608b5f6f376f33","amp;dn":"Auf+Wiedersehen+Pet+-+Season+Two","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7aa88f885c1e20b3073b9fb322608b5f6f376f33","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,168,143,136,92,30,32,179,7,59,159,179,34,96,139,95,111,55,111,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
