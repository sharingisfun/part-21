If you wish to share the files on the web, might\nI suggest you re-compress the sets of files with .ZIP or\n.7z? (more on that later)\n  These 2 Archives seem to have vaporized from the web, s\nif someone wishes to paste them up on their site/ftp, that\nwould be very cool.\n\n\nAtarimax EXE Archive.7z\nHomesoft Game Archive.7z\nVjetnam Atari 8-bit Game Archive.7z\n  These are smaller, but very action packed game archives!\n\n\nAtari800WinPlus 40.7z\n  This is the final word in Atari 8-bit emulators for\nwindows. The OS Roms are contained within the included\nPCXF25 (PC Xformer 2.5) Emulator. Other roms\ncan be found here and there around the web. Released by\nAtari to the public domain.\n\n\nIncluded Archivers:\n\n\nPeaZip (peazip-2.1.bin.WINDOWS.exe)\n  Used to Bust open the GZ/Tarballs and put them in\ndirectories.\n\n\n7-Zip (7z457.exe)\n  Used to unzip to folders/files the old zips, and used to\nmake the .7z that contain the archives. (you\\&amp;#039;ll need this)\n\n\nUniversal Extractor (uniextract15.exe)\n  Used to un-arc those nasty old .ARCs the big archives had in\nthem. Nothing kills an 8-bit buzz than having to use the\nemulator just to break open a stupid archive to play the\ndisk image therin. That is also why the internal .zips and\ntarballs have been broken out.\n\n\nI hope you enjoy this! I sure do!\n\nSupport filetopia.org if you like it!\n\nWith love,\nAnonymous","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90e06d62b89cf20886f2282a98d5bc51c97e4969","amp;dn":"Atari+8-bit+Archive+of+Archives","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90e06d62b89cf20886f2282a98d5bc51c97e4969","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,224,109,98,184,156,242,8,134,242,40,42,152,213,188,81,201,126,73,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
