The melodies are tuneful and immediately forgettable, lots of accented beats, \ncharm frothing from the orchestra pit like a bubble bath. The story is preposterous nonsense, \nbut the final-act wedding festivities make for a happy ending with lots of anything-you-can-dance-I-can-dance-better splash and dash. \nMuch of Marius PetipaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s trademark choreography is included, the fouettÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©s ad infinitum, so the viewer is assured of a visual spectacle. \nThe Paris Opera Ballet has not only rescued this work from near extinction, but has given it a first-class production.\n\nThe original score was composed by Edouard Deldevez in 1846 for the Paris Opera. A year later Petipa produced the ballet for his debut in St. Petersburg. \nIn 1881, Petipa asked Ludwig Minkus to compose a new Pas de trois and a Grand Pas to be appended to the second act. \nIronically, MinkusÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s additions achieved greater popularity than the complete work. \nPaquita had fallen into such obscurity by the mid 20th century that it is not included in the 1950 edition of The Victor Book of Ballets and Ballet Music, \na volume that gives plot synopsis of 126 works, many of them on the fringe of the repertoire. BalanchineÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s volume of 101 Ballet Plots also excludes Paquita. \nEven the Minkus additions, which were often produced independent of the full work, were ignored in these otherwise comprehensive volumes.\n\nBrigitte LefÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨vre, ballet director of the Paris Opera, and Pierre Lacotte, choreographer, felt that the work was worthy of revival. \nLacotte knew people who had valuable knowledge of the work, and was able to draw on PetipaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s and Joseph MazillierÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s original choreography to reconstruct the dances. \nDavid Coleman revised and completed the score. The result is a joyous event, an evening in the theater filled with happy, tuneful music and exciting dancing. \nThe sets and costumes are colorful and attractive (this is a very traditional production), \nthe ballet is cast throughout with talented dancers who not only bring great technical expertise to their roles, but also infuse the characters with distinctive personalities.\n\nThe plot is a bit tricky to follow by merely watching the production. It is helpful, almost necessary, to read the synopsis in the accompanying booklet. \nHereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the story in brief: Lucien is obligated to marry Serafina, whoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s considered a good match. A band of gypsies arrives. \nTheir leader, IÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±igo, wants to marry Paquita, but Paquita has some mystery concerning her uncertain past. \nShe has a locket containing the portrait of her deceased father, a man she never knew. IÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±igo steals the locket so no one will discover her true identity, \nespecially Lucien, who is much more interested in Paquita than in his fiancÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©e Serafina. \nLetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s skip to the end: the locket is recovered (people in plays never destroy incriminating evidence), and lo and behold, Paquita is not a gypsy after all. \nSheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the daughter of Charles dÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Hervilly, a nobleman who was slain in a massacre precedent to act I. This news improves her marital eligibility. \nLucien dumps Serafina and all dance happily ever after.\n\nAgnÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨s Letestu, JosÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Martinez, and Karl Paquette are outstanding as Paguita, Lucien, and IÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±igo, respectively. \nThree members of the company deserve praise for their featured work in the act I Pas de trois. \nThe choreography throughout the ballet is inventive and interesting, and frequently exhilarating.\n\nDancers:\nPaquita - Agnes Letestu\nLucien d'Hervilly - Jose Martinez\nInigo - Karl Paquette\nLe General, Comte d'Hervilly - Richard Wilk\nLa Comtesse - Celine Talon\nDon Lopez de Mendoza - Jean-Marie Didiere\nDona Serafina - Beatrice Martel \n\nAspect Ratio: 1.78:1 \nRun Time: 1:42 \nchapters: 44\nresolution: 640x368\nVideo Codec: AVC/h.264\nAudio Codec: AAC \nEncoder handbrake: 0.9.5\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9bdc0db7521fb211f3f3ec2029a53f80f5e5e79e","amp;dn":"Paquita-Paris+ballet-2003%5BiPod+H264+DVDrip%5D%28with+chapters%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9bdc0db7521fb211f3f3ec2029a53f80f5e5e79e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,220,13,183,82,31,178,17,243,243,236,32,41,165,63,128,245,229,231,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
