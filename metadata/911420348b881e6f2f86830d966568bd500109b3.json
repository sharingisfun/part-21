Complex physical dynamics allow the chaos of the Jackass acts to come to life in the game, as each brutal, bone-jarring, blood-spurting stunt is different from the last and as each stunt challenges you to act even more crazy and wild. With more than 35 unique scenarios, players will get to virtually experience Jackass stunts too extreme for even their wildest dreams - from careening down the streetsof San Francisco in a garbage can while dodging traffic to running off on a golf cart at a golf course while trying to hit every destructible object in the way.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:911420348b881e6f2f86830d966568bd500109b3","amp;dn":"Jackass%3A+The+Game+%28PS2%29+%28NTSC%29+%28Fabio5ilva%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"911420348b881e6f2f86830d966568bd500109b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,20,32,52,139,136,30,111,47,134,131,13,150,101,104,189,80,1,9,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
