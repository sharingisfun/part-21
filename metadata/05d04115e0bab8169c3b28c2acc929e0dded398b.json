Dodds was also the older brother of drummer Warren &quot;Baby&quot; Dodds. The pair worked together in the New Orleans Bootblacks in 1926.\n\nBorn in Waveland, Mississippi, he moved to New Orleans in his youth, and studied clarinet with Lorenzo Tio. He played with the bands of Frankie Duson, Kid Ory, and Joe &quot;King&quot; Oliver. Dodds went to Chicago and played with Oliver's Creole Jazz Band, with which he first recorded in 1923. Dodds (pronouncedalso worked frequently with his good friend Natty Dominique during this period, a professional relationship that would last a lifetime. After the breakup of Oliver's band in 1924, Dodds replaced Alcide Nunez as the house clarinetist and bandleader of Kelly's Stables. He recorded with numerous small groups in Chicago, most notably Louis Armstrong's Hot 5 and Hot 7, and Jelly Roll Morton's Red Hot Peppers.\n\nNoted for his professionalism and virtuosity as a musician, and his heartfelt, heavily blues-laden style, Dodds was an important influence on later clarinetists, notably Benny Goodman.\n\nDodds did not record for most of the 1930s, affected by ill health. He died of a heart attack in Chicago in 1940.\n\nIn 1987, Dodds was inducted into the Down Beat Jazz Hall of Fame.\n\n01 - Blue Clarinet Stomp #1.mp3\n02 - Blue Clarinet Stomp #2.mp3\n03 - Blue Piano Stomp.mp3\n04 - Wolverine Blues  Jelly Roll Morton.mp3\n05 - Mr. Jelly Lord  Jelly Roll Morton.mp3\n06 - Bucktown Stomp.mp3\n07 - Weary City.mp3\n08 - Bull Fiddle Blues.mp3\n09 - Blue Washboard Stomp.mp3\n10 - Memphis Shake  Dixieland Jug Blowers.mp3\n11 - Carpet Alley BreakdownShake  Dixieland Jug Blowers.mp3\n12 - Hen Party BluesShake  Dixieland Jug Blowers.mp3\n13 - Sweet Lorraine.mp3\n14 - My Little Isabel.mp3\n15 - Pencil Papa.mp3\n16 - Heah' Me Talkin' #3.mp3\n17 - Heah' Me Talkin' #4.mp3\n18 - Goober Dance.mp3\n19 - Too Tight.mp3\n20 - Indigo Stomp #1.mp3\n21 - Indigo Stomp #2.mp3\n\nEnjoy!\n\nComments:  &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;aaddcfcfddcfcfc2c5dfd8d9eacdc7cbc3c684c9c5c7&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\nShare ratio of 5 or greater requested.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05d04115e0bab8169c3b28c2acc929e0dded398b","amp;dn":"Johnny+Dodds+-+Blue+Clarinet+Stomp+-+1990+-+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05d04115e0bab8169c3b28c2acc929e0dded398b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,208,65,21,224,186,184,22,156,59,40,194,172,201,41,224,221,237,57,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
