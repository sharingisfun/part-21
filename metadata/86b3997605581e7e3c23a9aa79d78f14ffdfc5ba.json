An emphasis on combustion, hydrodynamics, heat transfer, and material issues illustrates these concepts with numerous examples from actual operating plants. The relevance of design and feed-stock parameters to the operation of a CFB boiler are also examined, along with their impacts on designs of mechanical components, including cyclones, air distributor grids, and solid recycle systems. This versatile resource explains how fluidized bed equipment works and how the basic principles of thermodynamics and fluid mechanics influence design, while providing insight into planning new projects, troubleshooting existing equipment, and appreciating the capabilities and limitations of the process. From hydrodynamics to construction and maintenance, the author covers all of the essential information needed to understand, design, operate, and maintain a complete fluidized bed system. It is a must for clean coal technology as well as for biomass power generation","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86b3997605581e7e3c23a9aa79d78f14ffdfc5ba","amp;dn":"Circulating+Fluidized+Bed+Boilers+-+Design%2C+Operation+and+Mainte","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86b3997605581e7e3c23a9aa79d78f14ffdfc5ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,179,153,118,5,88,30,126,60,35,169,170,121,215,143,20,255,223,197,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
