The sound is slightly better as on the Rockin' Chicago releases.\n\n\n Press note:\n The next Straight Arrow release is Ã¢â‚¬Å“Chicago Double-StrikeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, which contains both Chicago 1977 concerts from a newly uncovered audience recordings which have not been in distribution previously (completely different tapes from previous Chicago Ã¢â‚¬â„¢77 release). \n\n The sound-quality is surprisingly good and you will feel that you are right in the middle of the crowd, cheering Elvis on as he delivers two solid, no-nonsense shows with plenty of highlights. \n His voice was strong and he was particularly impressive on songs like Ã¢â‚¬ËœFairytaleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Ã¢â‚¬ËœTrying To Get To YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Ã¢â‚¬ËœMy WayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ã¢â‚¬ËœHurtÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, with his voice really soaring on the high notes. \n Whatever the reason may have been for Elvis Ã¢â‚¬Ëœupping his gameÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ on those two nights Ã¢â‚¬â€œ some have suggested that it may have been due to the presence of several CBS execs Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the Chicago Ã¢â‚¬â„¢77 concerts now stand out as genuine highlights from those final, sad months in the life and career of Elvis Aaron Presley. \n Both recordings have a tremendous Ã¢â‚¬Ëœyou are thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ feel to them. Presented with the professionalism that you have come to expect from us, donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t miss this terrific release that will bring you back to those final glimpses of greatness of the greatest entertainer ever. \n\nEnjoy!\nThanks to the Original uploader!\nJeroep","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9f6e3b04517fdb92c8f4a7a2453de681770ab36","amp;dn":"Elvis+Presley+-+Chicago+double+strike+%282012%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9f6e3b04517fdb92c8f4a7a2453de681770ab36","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,246,227,176,69,23,253,185,44,143,74,122,36,83,222,104,23,112,171,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
