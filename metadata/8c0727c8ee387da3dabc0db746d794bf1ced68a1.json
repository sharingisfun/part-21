In his search, one candidate particularly stands out, a lovely ex-ballerina dressed in white. The widower cannot believe his good fortune, until he starts looking more closely at his potential bride-to-be: her autobiographical details don't quite check out, she has a number of ugly scars on her legs, and he learns that people in her life have a habit of disappearing. When he discovers a man trussed up in her living room with his tongue and feet lopped off, he concludes that she is perhaps not the woman of his dreams. Audition was screened at the 1999 Vancouver Film Festival.\n\n\n\nSTARS.........: Ryo Ishibashi, Eihi Shiina, Tetsu Sawaki\nDIRECTOR......: Takashi Miike\nWRITER........: Daisuke Tengan\nGENRE.........: Drama | Horror | Romance\nRATING........: 7.2/10 51,568 Users\nMETASCORE.....: 69/100\nIMDB LINK.....: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0235198/\nRUNTIME.......: 1hr 55mn\nSIZE..........: 4.03GB\nVIDEO CODEC...: x264\nRESOLUTION....: 1920x1080\nBITRATE.......: 4500 kbps\nFRAMERATE.....: 23.976\nAUDIO.........: Japanese AC3 5.0 512kbps\nCHAPTERS......: Yes\nSUBTITLES.....: ENG\nSOURCE........: Odishon.1999.Unrated.Cut.1080p.Blu-ray.Remux.AVC.DTS-HD.MA.5.0-KRaLiMaRKo\nENCODED BY....: Sartre\nENCODE DATE...: 2015-09-20\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imagizer.imageshack.com/img661/3779/o8Up3Z.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imagizer.imageshack.com/img661/3779/o8Up3Z.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imagizer.imageshack.com/img673/9787/F5w6Am.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imagizer.imageshack.com/img673/9787/F5w6Am.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imagizer.imageshack.com/img540/5660/d4ZPko.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imagizer.imageshack.com/img540/5660/d4ZPko.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imagizer.imageshack.com/img673/4240/msZIt6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imagizer.imageshack.com/img673/4240/msZIt6.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c0727c8ee387da3dabc0db746d794bf1ced68a1","amp;dn":"Audition.%28Odishon%29.1999.1080p.BluRay.x264.AC3-SARTRE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c0727c8ee387da3dabc0db746d794bf1ced68a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,7,39,200,238,56,125,163,218,188,13,183,70,215,148,191,28,237,104,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
