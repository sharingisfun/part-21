You play as the eponymous Shovel Knight, a small knight with a huge quest. Shovel Knight has come to this valley with two goals: to defeat the evil Enchantress and save his lost beloved. He wields a ShovelBlade; a multipurpose weapon whose techniques have now been lost to the ages. Always honest and helpful, Shovel Knight is a shining example of the code of Shovelry: Slash Mercilessly and Dig Tirelessly!\n\nHowever, between Shovel Knight and his beloved stands a cadre of villainous knights. These terrible foes, known as The Order of No Quarter, have been dispatched to prevent Shovel Knight from reaching the Enchantress at any cost!\n\n---\n\nIGN 90\nShovel Knight is my favorite game of 2014 so far, and a true testament to the power of the old-school. Whether you were weaned on an NES like I was, or don't yet know what you missed in a time before you were born, Shovel Knight is an absolute must-play.\n\nEurogamer 70\nThere is gold in these old genres, and Shovel Knight is a successful dig.\n\n\nWorth Playing 90\nUnless you absolutely must have your games made of polygons or completely hate the indie movement, you need to have Shovel Knight in your video game library.\n\n\nMultiplayer.it\nTake a shovel. Take a knight. Sum them up. Shake with a NES cartridge. The result is probably a masterpiece.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:38b5951e5240dbac5b51396691a45504a45a00a5","amp;dn":"Shovel+Knight+%5BNative%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"38b5951e5240dbac5b51396691a45504a45a00a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,181,149,30,82,64,219,172,91,81,57,102,145,164,85,4,164,90,0,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
