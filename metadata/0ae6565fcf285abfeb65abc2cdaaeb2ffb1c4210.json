Each person adding a shade of darkness to each song and the album as a whole. What am I talking about? Well, last summer we recorded our new album in Dublin and it we gave it the name of &quot;Pessimist&quot;, written and recorded in a different way and in a somewhat new departure. F\n\nor a start, the lyrics are a step away from what we've been predominantly dealing with in the past. This time were focusing on depression, alienation, dark thoughts, loneliness, shame and regret. Brought on, I guess from years of alcoholism and living in a very dark place, I get lots of inspiration for an unhealthy album of genuinely bad vibes. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s going to be a stark brutally honest record. In the past I've gotten most satisfaction from singing songs about my own soul and feelings, e.g. Temple of rancid filth, traumatic stress solution, carrion caresses, among others so I've wrote a whole album of lyrics of introspection and decided to psychologically beat the crap out of myself for this one. Why do I need to look in ancient old occult books for horror when all you have to do is take a long good hard look in the mirror? Practically, we also decided to keep it as live and lo-fi as possible.\n\nOver the past few years I for one have gone back to listening to a lot of old shit eg, repulsion, siege, terrorizer and stuff like the grindcore peel sessions. (Carcass, Napalm and ENT) and also realizing I prefer most demos to big budget albums, this inspired us to record this in one or two takes and dropped the vocals in after also in one or two takes. The whole thing took about 3 days. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been recorded at the Hive in Dublin, mastered by audio-siege in Oregon, and at the moment we've commissioned Manuel Tinnemans to create some dark artwork to suit the mood of the sick demented psychological breakdown of the pessimist. We've also signed with a new label, news of which will be forthcoming in a couple of weeks, Its going to be a dark year for grind when this sick morbid, crusty, grindcore filth lands in your ears in 2014. Looking forward to you guys hearing it and catching you at some shows this coming summer.\n\nDiscography:\n\n&quot;When the Demons Come&quot; demo 1995\n&quot;Aeons of us Rising&quot; promo 1997.\n&quot;The Last Supper&quot; Seasons of mist records 1999\n&quot;Nadir&quot; Sentinel records 2001,\n&quot;Dark Crusade&quot; Xtreeme music 2004,\n&quot;Cascade&quot; Metal age productions 2009\n&quot;Split 7&quot; (with phobia) Underground movement 2011\n&quot;Pessimist&quot; candlelight records 2014\n\n\nCBR @ 320kbps\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.Pessimist\n02.Aborted Genesis\n03.Yester Hara\n04.Warping The Necro Spawn\n05.Broken Spectre\n06.Fear\n07.Impaled Upon Your Zodiac\n08.Prison Of Introspection\n09.Nameless Grave\n10.Morbid Epiphany\n11.Solstice Of Homicide\n12.Undead Outcasts\n13.Funeral Hag\n14.Summoning Famine-Inherit An Empty World\n\n\n\nLine-up:\n\nSteve Maher - Vocals, Guitar\nBill Whelan - Vocals, Guitar\nSteve Finnerty - Vocals, Bass\nJohnny King - Drums\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ae6565fcf285abfeb65abc2cdaaeb2ffb1c4210","amp;dn":"Abaddon+Incarnate+-+Pessimist++mp3++320k++2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ae6565fcf285abfeb65abc2cdaaeb2ffb1c4210","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,230,86,95,207,40,90,191,235,101,171,194,205,170,235,47,251,28,66,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
