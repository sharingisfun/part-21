These categories are not open to popular vote and will be chosen by a panel! The winners will be announced on August 25 . The MTV VMAs 2013 take place for the first time in Brooklyn, New York at the Barclays Centre from 9pm.\n\nMy comment: Nicely deserved but still so robbed. Ride is Video of the Year! No wait, National Anthem is...too.\n\nSo for the second year in a row Lana received 2 VMA's noms, but again for only technical categories. When over this same time period she has literally changed the face of video.\n\nTaylor Swift is nominated for the 2013 Video of the Year, for 'I Knew You Were Trouble.' That video is but a pale Lana imitation. Well, at least the girl's got good taste. And Taylor is acceptable to America. Lana since the &quot;SNL bomb scare&quot; is somehow still damaged goods in this country. We just don't get it. Like they do in Sister Europe.\n\nFuck, I got into Lana because of what had happened at SNL. I had not heard of her till then. I thought to myself, don't believe the anti-hype. She can't be that bad. I got to check her out. And for at least once in my life, I was right.\n\nMTV has no balls anyway. That is why no one watches anymore. So WTFC. Lana has raw beautiful balls. I mean freak Kanye, who still cannot even sing.\n\nLana is the most dangerous, daring singer in the popular arena. And an mother-effin video genius. \n\nLana Del Rey spells music magic vision.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Lana/NewPicture1-1.jpg~original&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Lana/NewPicture1-1.jpg~original&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Lana/NewPicture2-1.jpg~original&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Lana/NewPicture2-1.jpg~original&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Lana/NewPicture3-1.jpg~original&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Lana/NewPicture3-1.jpg~original&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Lana/NewPicture10-2.jpg~original&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Lana/NewPicture10-2.jpg~original&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Lana/NewPicture15.jpg~original&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Lana/NewPicture15.jpg~original&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Lana/NewPicture16.jpg~original&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Lana/NewPicture16.jpg~original&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Lana/NewPicture19.jpg~original&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Lana/NewPicture19.jpg~original&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Lana/NewPicture18-1.jpg~original&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Lana/NewPicture18-1.jpg~original&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d99efa37637baa44f824c1efa44c9e8fb26e44f","amp;dn":"Lana+Del+Rey+-+National+Anthem+%282012+-+Blu-ray+1080p+PCM%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d99efa37637baa44f824c1efa44c9e8fb26e44f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,153,239,163,118,55,186,164,79,130,76,30,250,68,201,232,251,38,228,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
