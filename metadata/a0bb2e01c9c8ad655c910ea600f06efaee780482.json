Pop perfection:\n\nwww.labrador.se\n\nBiography\nSweden?s no 1 guitar pop band. Acid House Kings was started\nby the teenagers Joakim Ãƒâ€“dlund {also in Poprace, Starlet and\nDoubledan}, brothers Niklas {also in Red Sleeping Beauty} and\nJohan AngergÃƒÂ¥rd {also in Club 8, Poprace and The Legends}\nback in 1991 inspired by the English anorak scene {most\nbands on labels like Sarah, Subway and Heaven would be\nconsidered as favorites at this time}. The band recorded their\nfirst songs and sent them only to one label, the German pop\nlabel Marsh-Marigold. A few months later their debut single\nÃ‚Â»Play pop! EPÃ‚Â« was released.\n\nIn 1992, Acid House Kings set up a 10 year plan: a trilogy of\nalbums with one album released exactly every 5th year. Each\nalbum was to be filled with catchy guitar pop songs but with\nnew themes and a growing maturity from album to album. The\nfirst album in trilogy was the twee Ã‚Â»Pop, look &amp; listenÃ‚Â«\nreleased on Marsh-Marigold in 1992. The album was followed\nby the 6-track ep Ã‚Â»Monaco G.P.Ã‚Â« and a European tour in\n1994.\n\nWith the 2nd part of Acid House Kings album trilogy the band\nwanted to create catchy quality pop {a bit like The Smiths for\nsummer days instead of lonely autumn nights looked up in\nyour room}. That album was Ã‚Â»Advantage Acid House KingsÃ‚Â«.\nThe band changed labels for this album to Shelflife in the US\nand Harmony in Japan. On this album the singer Julia\nLannerheim was introduced in the band as a guest singer on a\ncouple of songs. The album was released in rather small\nquantities and sold out quickly. It&amp;#039;s now been re-released by\nLabrador Records.\n\nIn 2001 Acid House Kings built a studio of their own,\nSummersound Studios, in order to make a perfectly\nsophisticated pop production for the 3rd installment in the\ntrilogy. Joakim was unable to make it to the recording studio\nbecause of the fact that he was living too far from it. But on\nthe other hand Julia became a full-time member of the band.\nThe year was a creative burst for the Kings. The result was\nÃ‚Â»Mondays are like Tuesdays and Tuesdays are like\nWednesdaysÃ‚Â«. It&amp;#039;s an easy, breezy, beautiful album with more\nlasting qualities than any of the other albums in the trilogy. It\nwas released in 2002 on Parasol (US), Quince (Japan),\nMagnum (South East Asia) and Labrador (Europe).\n\nALL MUSIC described ?Mondays...Ã‚Â« as ??yet more proof of\nthe emerging, Swedish indie pop scene. ? and gave it Rolling\nStone praised it as regal and ?full of sugary, yet bittersweet\nhooks?.\n\nSpurred by the wide acclaim for Ã‚Â»Mondays... Ã‚Â« Acid House\nKings immediately begun working on the plan for the second\n10 year period and on what was to become Ã‚Â»Sing along with\nAcid House Kings?. The new album also saw the return of\nfounding member Joakim Ãƒâ€“dlund on guitar.\n\nCombining the aesthetics of Kraftwerk with Motown girl groups\nfrom the 60?s and musical influences from Burt Bucharach to\nThe Smiths, Acid House Kings have created a classic album\nof timeless pop perfection. True to their Swedish origin, the\nKings cannot hide a certain debt to the stylish arrangements\nand crystal clear melodies of ABBA.\n\nThough the Ã‚Â»Mondays...Ã‚Â« album sounds just as great today\nas when it was first heard, there?s no doubt the new album is a\nbig step forward. The vocal duties are charmingly shared\nbetween the two singers, Niklas and Julia, the melodies direct\nand timeless and the arrangements multifaceted and rich in\ndetail.\n\nÃ‚Â»Sing along with Acid House KingsÃ‚Â« is not only a proof of the\nemerging Swedish pop scene, it?s the cream of the lot. And\nyes, you can sing along. They?ll even include a free karaoke\nDVD with the album {the very first in musical history} to help\nyou do so.
