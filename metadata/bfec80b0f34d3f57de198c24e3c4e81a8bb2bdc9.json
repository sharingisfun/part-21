Proper stewardship of natural assets and liabilities is a matter of planetary urgency: natural resources have the potential either to transform the poorest countries or to tear them apart, while the carbon emissions and agricultural follies of the rich world could further impoverish them. The Plundered Planet charts a course between unchecked profiteering on the one hand and environmental romanticism on the other to offer realistic and sustainable solutions to dauntingly complex issues.\nGrounded in a belief in the power of informed citizens, Collier proposes a series of international standards that would help poor countries rich in natural assets better manage those resources, policy changes that would raise world food supply, and a clear-headed approach to climate change that acknowledges the benefits of industrialization while addressing the need for alternatives to carbon trading. Revealing how these are all interconnected, The Plundered Planet charts a way forward to avoid the mismanagement of the natural world that threatens our future.\nEnjoy and seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bfec80b0f34d3f57de198c24e3c4e81a8bb2bdc9","amp;dn":"Collier+-+The+Plundered+Planet%3B+Why+We+Must+and+How+We+Can+Manag","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bfec80b0f34d3f57de198c24e3c4e81a8bb2bdc9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,236,128,176,243,77,63,87,222,25,140,36,227,196,232,26,139,178,189,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
