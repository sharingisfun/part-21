Some of the most dangerous pollutants come from commonplace items in our homes and workplacesÃ¢â‚¬â€shampoos and toothpastes, carpets and childrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s toys. \nTo prove this point, leading environmentalists Rick Smith and Bruce Lourie conducted their own research by ingesting and inhaling a host of things that are part of our everyday lives. Using their own bodies as the reference point to tell the story of pollution in our modern world, they expose the miscreant corporate giants who manufacture the toxins, the weak-kneed government officials who let it happen, and the effects on people and families across the globe. This bookÃ¢â‚¬â€the testimony of their experienceÃ¢â‚¬â€exposes the extent to which we are poisoned every day of our lives.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b10374144c94ac68fb22724212757a096c28112f","amp;dn":"Slow+Death+by+Rubber+Duck+The+Secret+Danger+of+Everyday+Things+b","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b10374144c94ac68fb22724212757a096c28112f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,3,116,20,76,148,172,104,251,34,114,66,18,117,122,9,108,40,17,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
