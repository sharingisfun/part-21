But behind this project there was an important multinational with too much power and they don't want to give up from the project, because there's too much money involvedÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ so they use a dirty way to &quot;catch him&quot;: They contract a high-society call girl, Maria (played by Soraia Chaves), to seduce the President Meireles (played by Nicolau Breyner) and control him to the point of making him sign the project. Beautiful as she is, Meireles was caught from the first moment! He didn't resist, as expected! Beside, from the beginning of the plot, we also follow two detectives of PolÃƒÂ­cia Judiciaria, Madeira (Ivo Canelas) and Neves (Jose Raposo) that, by chance, get noticed of this crime of corruption and start investigating. The result you will see in the end of the movieÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nRip Specs (DVD Rip)\n\nGeneral           : Call Girl.2007.DVDRip.x264.mkv\nFormat            : Matroska at 2 613 Kbps\nLength            : 2.48 GiB for 2h 15mn 43s 800ms\n\nVideo #0          : AVC at 2 150 Kbps\nAspect            : 716 x 552 (1.844) at 25.000 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AC-3 at 448 Kbps\nInfos             : 6 channels, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage          : pt\n\nText #0           : VobSub\nLanguage          : en\n\nText #1           : VobSub\nLanguage          : pt\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1043835/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1043835/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAudio Language: Portuguese\nSubtitles: English, Portuguese","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e03c4defce76878a657ce2e16e70a4b89690ba7","amp;dn":"Call+Girl.2007.DVDRip.x264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e03c4defce76878a657ce2e16e70a4b89690ba7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,3,196,222,252,231,104,120,166,87,206,46,22,231,10,75,137,105,11,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
