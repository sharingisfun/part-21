The nine-cut date,  reissued by Original Blues Classics, included such laments as &quot;I Hate to Be Alone,&quot; &quot;Lonely Day,&quot; and &quot;She Ain't for Nobody,&quot; as well as the poignant &quot;Yes Lawd,&quot; and less weighty &quot;Satellite Baby&quot; and &quot;Jailbait.&quot; Besides Sykes' alternately bemused, ironic, and inviting vocals, there's superb tenor sax support from King Curtis, Robert Banks' tasty organ, and steady, nimble bass and drum assistance by Leonard Gaskin and drummer Belton Evans.
