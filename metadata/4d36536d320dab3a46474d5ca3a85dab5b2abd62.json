Since Microsoft Flight Simulator X doesn't come bundled with such realistic effects, we had to think out of the box to create this new sense of immersion. In addition to our generic package, and since every aircraft and scenery is different, we decided to develop addon-specific packages. This allows us to push the boundaries of what's never been seen before in terms of visual effects!\r\n\r\nhapy flying","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d36536d320dab3a46474d5ca3a85dab5b2abd62","amp;dn":"%5Bfsx%2Fp3d3%5DFSFX+Packages","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d36536d320dab3a46474d5ca3a85dab5b2abd62","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,54,83,109,50,13,171,58,70,71,77,92,163,168,93,171,91,42,189,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
