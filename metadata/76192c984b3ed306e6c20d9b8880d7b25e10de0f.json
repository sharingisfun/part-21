This torrent was made to promote the included bands/guitarists and spread some metal gems of the past and present. You will discover many rare treasures here.\n\nI hope you enjoy what I consider to be some of the best albums in metal. This pack focuses on progressive power, neoclassical &amp; instrumental metal. Many of the albums are blends of these styles and include exotic elements, such as Eastern/Asian/Arabic influences. You're in for a treat!\n\n\nAlbum list\n-----------\n7 DAYS - The Weight of the World [2006]\nADAGIO - Sanctus Ignis [2006]\nALOGIA - Secret Spheres of Art [2005]\nALTONA - Altona [2008] *\nANUBIS GATE - A Perfect Forever [2005]\nARACHNES - Apocalypse [2002] *\nARACHNES - Primary Fear [ 2003] *\nARTCH - Another Return [Reissue 2001] [+1] [1988] *\nASHENT - Ashent [Demo] [2003] *\nASLAN - Aslan [Demo] [1986]\nBATTLEFIELD - Still and Ever Again [1991]\nBEHOLDER - Wish for Destruction [2002]\nCASUS BELLI - Mirror Out of Time [2001] *\nCASUS BELLI - Holy Gates [Demo] [2004] *\nCONCERTO MOON - Rain Forest [2000]\nDELTA - Black &amp; Cold [2007]\nESSENCE OF SORROW - Reflections of the Obscure [2007]\nIMPELLITERRI - Impellitteri [1987]\nINNERCHACOS - Different Stories [2005]\nJEWEL - La Morta [EP] [1988]\nLIGHTMARE - The Fool [1997] *\nLOST HORIZON - Awakening the World [2001]\nMEHIDA - Blood &amp; Water [2007]\nMYRATH - Hope [2007]\nMYSTIC FORCE - The Eternal Quest [1991] *\nNEMESIS - Goddess of Revenge [2003]\nPATHOS - Katharsis [2002]\nPYRAMAZE - Melancholy Beast [2004]\nSPIRIT WEB - Spirit Web [Reissue 2002] [2000]\nSTORMWIND - Reflections [2001]\nTERRA ROSA - The Endless Basis [1987] *\nTITAN FORCE - Titan Force [1989]\nTITAN FORCE - Winner, Loser [1991]\nTWILIGHT - Eye for an Eye [2000]\nWICKED MYSTIC - The Paramount Question [2000]\nXYSTUS - Receiving Tomorrow [2004]\nYNIS VITRIN - A Dark Land [2005]\nZANITY - Time Out of Mind [Demo] [1987]\nZEELION - Steel Attack [2006]\nZIONS ABYSS - T.A.L.E.S [1991] *\n\n\nAKIRA KAJIYAMA - Akira Kajiyama [2008]\nALPH LYLA &amp; YUJI TORIYAMA - Street Fighter II [1996] *\nBOB KATSIONIS - Turn of My Century [2002]\nBOB KATSIONIS - Imaginary Force [2004]\nBORISLAV MITIC - Fantasy [1996]\nBORISLAV MITIC - Borislav Mitic [1998]\nDAISUKE ISHIWATARI - Guilty Gear Isuka OST [2004]\nDAVID VALDES - Paradise Lost [2002] *\nDAVID VALDES - Imhotep [2007]\nGUITAR HEROES - Guitar Heroes [2007]\nKATSU OHTA - The Right Brain Revoluton [2000] *\nKATSU OHTA - Micronist [2003] *\nKOJI TSUMOTO - Silkroad, Kinu Michi - 1st [2002]\nKOPECKY - Kopecky [1999]\nKOPECKY - Orion [2001] *\nKOYAANISQATSY - From the Yearning to Burst the Perpetual Circle [2000]\nKUNI - Masque [1986]\nKUROKI MASAHIKO - K-Works [2001] *\nMICHAEL HARRIS - Distorted Views [J] [+2] [1999] *\nMICHAEL ORLANDO - Sonic Stomp [2006]\nMIKE DIMARELI - Fantasy [2004]\nSATOSHI MIYASHITA - Lords of Thunder [Redbook] [1993] *\nSATOSHI MIYASHITA - Ginga Fukei Densetsu Sapphire [Redbook] [1995]\nTARO BANDO - F-Zero X Guitar Arrange Edition [1999]\nVITALIJ KUPRIJ - High Definition [1997]\nYNGWIE MALMSTEEN - Powerhouse - The 1978 Demos [Bootleg] [1978]\nYNGWIE MALMSTEEN - Rising Force [Demo] [1980]\nYNGWIE MALMSTEEN - Rehersals [Bootleg] [1983]\nYNGWIE MALMSTEEN - Rising Force [1st Press] [J] [1984] *\nYNGWIE MALMSTEEN - Rising Force [Remaster 2007] [1984]\nYNGWIE MALMSTEEN - Fanclub Only Vinyl 1 [Demo] [1985]\nYNGWIE MALMSTEEN - Power and Glory [1994] *\n\n\nVARIOUS ARTISTS - Instrumental Metal\nVARIOUS ARTISTS - Melodic Power\nVARIOUS ARTISTS - Prog Power\n\n\n\nBitrate info\n-------------\nMy rips are indicated with a star * after the album name. My rips use this setting -V2 --vbr-new (Lame 3.98.2). The bitrate is approx. 224 kb/s.\n\nBitrates for the other albums are not included in this description. All files pass for quality. I guess you have to take my word for it. Despite this, I would offer better rips of some of the albums if they were available. If you want more details on each album, you can search the artist on Encyclopaedia Metallum [http://metal-archives.com].\n\n\nEnd\n----\nThanks to everyone who has supported the genre.
