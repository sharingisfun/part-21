Her best friend, Tara, is devastated and bewildered. Has Lisa broken her sobriety or has she gone into hiding because she is afraid to tell her partner, Ryan, that she is pregnant and he may not be the father? Worse, Ryan has a history of battery. Could he have harmed her?\n\nTake a roller coaster ride with Tara Richards as she falls headfirst into a comical midlife crisis while dealing with the grave situation of searching for her missing friend, with a little help from her left-wing feminist friends, some old-fashioned, traditional Catholics from LisaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s parentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ church, and a 24-year-old man with whom she is smitten.
