His parents split when he was young, and he would see his father several times a year. He first began playing guitar while attending a private high school, and he was particularly fascinated with slide guitar technique. He saw his idol, Jimmy Reed, perform at New York's Apollo Theater, and he's never been the same since.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd17d7a9f94d9742b13c678a4c14b7022a665b45","amp;dn":"%28Blues%29+John+Hammond+-+Source+Point","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd17d7a9f94d9742b13c678a4c14b7022a665b45","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,23,215,169,249,77,151,66,177,60,103,138,76,20,183,2,42,102,91,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
