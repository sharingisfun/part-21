Whether its renaming 1,000's, replicating a tree structure without its files, copying with graceful error recovery or performing many other tasks, FileBoss performs ordinary, and many not-so-ordinary, jobs in an extra-ordinary fashion. And onscreen results and error windows can keep your informed every step along the way.\n\nNo longer do you need to have separate, underpowered programs to rename, copy, compare or find files. FileBoss handles it all - and much, much more - with one intuitive interface. And not just one folder at a time: FileBoss can rename, copy, move, drag and drop and perform other operations on thousands of files at once.\n\nIn addition to extending common Windows Explorer functions so that they are actually useful, FileBoss includes integrated functions that manipulate and change files in one folder, many folders, one a drive, across several drives and even across a network.\n\nFor example, from renaming one file to renaming thousands across several disks with sophisticated transformations, FileBoss has a facility to make the process quick and easy. Add sequential numbers, delete or change spaces, change case - even to first caps - change names and add file times to names and more. Confirm each or let FileBoss do them all automatically.\n\nFileBoss can be easily configured as the default viewer for File Folders allowing it to be displayed when a folder on the Desktop or other folder is double-clicked. But it will never usurp functions you don't want it to do nor will it create any nasty hooks to mess up your system.\n\nWith the same familiar interface that is used for other operations FileBoss's can compare, merge and purge Folders, Paths, Drives and even Network storage areas. Merging can be automatic or highly selective - as suits your needs.\n\nHomepage of FileBoss:\nwww.TheUtilityFactory.com\n\nVista, XP.\n\n----------\nInstall guide\n1) Install by launching 'fileboss_setup'\n2) Don't start FileBoss after installation is finished. Exit FileBoss if it is running.\n3) Replace (overwrite) the file 'FileBoss.exe' in the folder where FileBoss is installed (usually C:ProgramFileBoss V2) with the file provided in the folder 'Replace fileboss with file in this folder'.\n4) Done.\n----------\nThis one is tested under Windows XP 32 bit.\nCredits to TUC2020.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c5f95bc0a83e2ecb9ecda5c8f33752e699d92b84","amp;dn":"FileBoss+v2.301+%2832+bit%29+-+Windows+File+Manager","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c5f95bc0a83e2ecb9ecda5c8f33752e699d92b84","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,249,91,192,168,62,46,203,158,205,165,200,243,55,82,230,153,217,43,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
