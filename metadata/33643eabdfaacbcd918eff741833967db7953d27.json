I'm not talking about mushrooms but\neven them are a very good teacher for the ones who are lost. nature is the key! but anarchy is the way.\nand fuck that just as hard! I would like to say: fuck the government, fuck the rules and live like you want to live.\nthere's no law accept the one you create from your own self. and yes, fuck me too with my stupid bull!\nthink for yourself dude and dudette! wraaaah!\n\n\nall made on a fucked up laptop, crap microphone, kazoo and a lot of sampled items i found along the way.\ntrust me, i'm crazy, i admit i cant sing, i cant play, and cant even write proper english, but who cares?\nyou understand what i'm saying? and if not? so be it, just enjoy the music, the sun, the rain,\nthe crazy train we are all sitting in! enjoy! and fuck up the control freaks!\n\ndare to be chicken, very pock!\ntoxic chicken\n\nour art collective with anti political bull and animations stuff:: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.dreamsociety.co.uk&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.dreamsociety.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;\n\n100.000.000.000 times thanks for all the good free internet labels out there who releases the best shit I've ever heard!\ni dont want to pay for good music and i dont want to pay for bad music! i just want to play music!\nwraah! the van of the Looney house just arrived. got to go! see yah!\nbig up for dramacore!!!! whoooooooooooooo!!!!!\n\nJAH!!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33643eabdfaacbcd918eff741833967db7953d27","amp;dn":"toxic+chicken+-+biscuits+with+jesus+%5BElectro%2FBreakcore%2FIDM%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33643eabdfaacbcd918eff741833967db7953d27","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,100,62,171,223,170,203,205,145,142,255,116,24,51,150,125,183,149,61,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
