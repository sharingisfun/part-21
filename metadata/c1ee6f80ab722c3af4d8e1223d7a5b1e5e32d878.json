It means that they use guitars and electronic instruments in equal proportions, taking the best from both worlds. Those into beats will find them, those who prefer more conservative goth/guitar sounds will be pleased as well.\n\nThe band members have a good deal of experience behind them. Even though ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSounds of the MomentsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is their first release, it does not sound like a debut. The music is mature and the bands has the phase of experiments well behind them. Very nice female vocals are strong selling point of this release. \n\nMusic from ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSounds of the MomentsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ works well on stage and in a club setting. In both cases it just shows a different face.\n\n-------------------------------\nSounds similiar to/inspired by:\n-------------------------------\nBlutengel, Seelenkrank, Kirlian Camera, Flesh Field, The Cruxshadows, Anne Clark, Terminal Choice, Trummerwelten, Closterkeller, Colony 5, Deine Lakaien, Diorama, Bauhaus, Joy Division, The Sister of Mercy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1ee6f80ab722c3af4d8e1223d7a5b1e5e32d878","amp;dn":"Goth+Electro-Lily+of+the+Valley-Sounds+of+the+Moments","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c1ee6f80ab722c3af4d8e1223d7a5b1e5e32d878","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,238,111,128,171,114,44,58,244,216,225,34,61,122,91,30,94,50,216,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
