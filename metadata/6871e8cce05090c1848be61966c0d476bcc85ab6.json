The visual component of it is typically high quality, high screen resolution (1920x808) and lower on the file size (1832kbps) x264. Congrats to YIFY for another great visual encode.\n\nI remastered the soundtrack in Audacity: compressed for vocals, hard limited and levelled, amplified to -1dB, then sync corrected to 100ms. Final rendering is AC3 @ 448kbps.\n\nThis is the theatrical release, not the Director's cut. I downloaded something advertised as the DC, but it wasn't. Screen time is 2 hours 13 minutes. I hope you enjoy this revamped version of Donnie Darko.\n\nCheers,\nMoofieMan.\n\nSeeders are cool.
