They are the fantastic Pet Shop\nBoys ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and they have put together a real treat for Mail on Sunday\nreaders.\n\nThis weekend, inside your paper, will be a brilliant FREE CD of their\ngreatest hits ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ especially compiled by the Pet Shop Boys themselves,\nNeil Tennant and Chris Lowe.\n\nAnd for this exclusive CD they have even provided a special track, Did\nYou See Me Coming?, taken from their new album ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ which wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t be in\nthe shops for another three weeks.\n\n\n\nWhat Have I Done To Deserve This? Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe of\nthe Pet Shop Boys were Brit 2009 Outstanding Contribution award\nwinners\n\nYour FREE CD ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Pet Shop Boys Story: 25 Years Of Hits ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ includes\nclassic tracks such as West End Girls, Go West, ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s A Sin and eight\nother great songs spanning their chart career.\n\nIn an exclusive interview to announce their Mail on Sunday CD,\nTennant and Lowe revealed that, though their wild days are over, they\nare still exploring new musical frontiers.\n\nThe anniversary of their 25th year in the business will be marked by\nnothing more colourful than yet more hard work as they plan summer\nconcerts in London and Manchester.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“The party days are over,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ admits Lowe, 49. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“The wildest night IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve\nbeen on recently is a trip to the opera with my mother and sister. By\nthe time we had dinner it was pushing midnight.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢\n\nHe added: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Before we go on stage, I normally have a lie-down. Before\nthe Brits, Neil had a white-wine spritzer. I had a rest.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢\n\nTheir musical repertoire is changing, too: the Pet Shop Boys are\nwriting a ballet inspired by a Hans Christian Andersen story ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ to be\nperformed at SadlerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Wells theatre in London in 2011.\n\n\nFlamboyant: The boys have clocked up 22 Top 10 singles in 25 years\n\n\nBeing Boring? Neil and Chris say their party days are over\n\nTheir favourite current bands include MGMT, Arctic Monkeys and The\nKillers. However, they do miss the excitement of the early years and\nsay the digital age and shows such as The X Factor have taken away\nsome of the thrill of music.\n\nLowe laments: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Now that X Factor is guaranteed No1 every Christmas,\nthereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s no genuine excitement, no asking whatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s it going to be this\nyear?\n\nItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ruined Christmas. In the past you had to spend afternoons in\nrecord shops listening for whatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s good. Now weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve got internet access,\nyouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve lost that sense of excitement.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢\n\nMeanwhile the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s fans have remained unswervingly loyal. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m\nastonished to see them still there,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ says Tennant. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“They understood\nour sense of humour and they still do.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“There was a girl who used to sit on the wall outside my house revising\nfor her A-Levels in the mid-Eighties. There she was at a gig in London\nrecently. She doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t look a bit different.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Another woman has written to me since 1985 when she was a little\ngirl. Now sheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s got a second child on the way.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢\n\nAnd the fans will be delighted that another Pet Shop Boys studio\nalbum is on the way. The album, Yes, will be released on March 23.\n\nTennant says: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a real privilege to get up on stage and get a\nreaction. That, and scoring a goal for your football team, are the two\nthings youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve got to appreciate in life. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s such a good feeling. I donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t\nsee any reason why you canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t be up there and performing at 70.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢\n\nPet Shop Boys Story: 25 Years Of Hits will make a truly unmissable\naddition to your music collection ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s available only in The Mail\non Sunday this weekend.\n\nDemand is sure to be huge, so make sure you order your copy today.\n\n\n\n   1.
