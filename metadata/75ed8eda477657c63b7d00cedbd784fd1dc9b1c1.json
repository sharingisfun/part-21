With more than 5 million copies sold in the U.S. and 4 million copies sold out of the U.S., it is their best selling album. The album begins on track 13, following 12 tracks of silence. The reason, as mentioned in an interview with Metal Hammer UK around the time of release, was that Jonathan Davis did not like the fact that the album would have ended on the thirteenth track (due to superstition), so they preferred to start that album on that track instead. An alternate explanation for the reason the song started on the 13 track is that the first 12 tracks were 5 seconds of silence each adding up to one minute of silence in honor of Justin, a young fan of the band that died of cancer. Justin also has a song on the CD named after him.\n\n* * * I Have Split Track 25 Into 3 Separate Tracks - But I Have Also Left The Original.\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Silence\n[02] Silence\n[03] Silence\n[04] Silence\n[05] Silence\n[06] Silence\n[07] Silence\n[08] Silence\n[09] Silence\n[10] Silence\n[11] Silence\n[12] Silence\n[13] It's On!\n[14] Freak On A Leash\n[15] Got The Life\n[16] Dead Bodies Everywhere\n[17] Children Of The Korn\t---&gt; Featuring Ice Cube\n[18] B.B.K.\n[19] Pretty\n[20] All In The Family\t---&gt; Featuring Fred Durst\n[21] Reclaim My Place\n[22] Justin\n[23] Seed\n[24] Cameltosis\t\t---&gt; Featuring Tre Hardson\n[25] My Gift To You \t---&gt; [Bonus Hidden Tracks - Spoken Dialogue &amp; Earache My Eye]\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[25] My Gift To You \t---&gt; [Split]\n[26] Spoken Dialogue \t---&gt; [Split - Bonus Hidden Track]\n[27] Earache My Eye\t---&gt; [Split - Bonus Hidden Track]\n\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time\t---&gt; 01h:10m:01s [Excluding Split Tracks]\n\t\t\t---&gt; 01h:23m:38s [Including Split Tracks]\n\nTotal File Size\t\t---&gt; 206mb (Including Mp3s, Art Covers &amp; WorDoc)\n\nTotal Bit Size\t\t---&gt; 320kbps\n\nMusic File Type\t\t---&gt; I- Tunes v8.1.1.10 Mp3 Format\n\nMusic video Format \t---&gt; N / A\n\nScanned Artwork\t\t---&gt; Yes @ 300dpi\n\nOriginal CD Rip\t\t---&gt; Yes - only1joe\n\nOriginal Uploader\t\t---&gt; Yes - only1joe \n\nUpload Speed\t\t---&gt; 33-35KB/s\n\nMusic Genre\t\t---&gt; Metal Rock\n\nOriginally Released\t---&gt; 18 August 1998\n\nRecord Company\t\t---&gt; Sony Music\n\nArtist Website\t\t---&gt; http://modlife.com/korn \n\t\t\t---&gt; http://modlife.com/korn/twitter \n\t\t\t---&gt; http://www.bebo.com/korn \n\t\t\t---&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korn \n\t\t\t---&gt; http://www.azlyrics.com/k/korn.html \n\t\t\t---&gt; http://www.muzu.tv/korn \n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n* * * IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents  * * *\n* * * This Is A Multi-Tracker Torrent Check Your Torrent Client For The Number Of Seeds * * *\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:75ed8eda477657c63b7d00cedbd784fd1dc9b1c1","amp;dn":"%5B1998%5D+Follow+The+Leader+-+Korn+-+206mb+%40+320kbs+%5Bonly1joe%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"75ed8eda477657c63b7d00cedbd784fd1dc9b1c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,237,142,218,71,118,87,198,59,125,0,206,219,215,132,253,29,201,177,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
