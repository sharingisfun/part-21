She has issued 31 albums, with over 55 million records sold worldwide in her 33-year career. She ranks as the #7 best-selling female artist in all genres.\n\n\nStarting Over is the title of an album released by American country singer Reba McEntire in 1995. It was a tribute to her roots and influences, featuring covers of songs and artists who she admired growing up. Among the artists being covered were Dolly Parton, Linda Ronstadt, The Supremes, Lee Greenwood and Patti LaBelle. The album featured only one Top 10 single, &quot;Ring On Her Finger, Time On Her Hands&quot;, which was previously a Top Ten hit for Greenwood in the mid-1980s; McEntire's rendition was a Top Ten hit as well upon its 1996 release.\n\nMcEntire called on Trisha Yearwood, Martina McBride and Linda Davis to join her for On My Own, the album's first single.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0b0cccc6ff6352259ed63657a69d839e0e39e66","amp;dn":"Reba+McEntire+Starting+Over+%5Bmp3%5D%5Bh33t%5D%5BLoC.+Blazer%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0b0cccc6ff6352259ed63657a69d839e0e39e66","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,176,204,204,111,246,53,34,89,237,99,101,122,105,216,57,224,227,158,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
