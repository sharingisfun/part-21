You are using this entirely at your own risk. This image was designed to help computers, and while I have done everything reasonable to ensure that it functions as intended, I cannot test it in every situation. If this causes something bad to happen to your computer, don\\&amp;#039;t come crying to me. You should always backup your system. Remember: You get what you pay for.\n\nWHAT IS IT?\nMany operations require you to \\&quot;unmount\\&quot; your hard drive or partition such as:  Fixing, Optimizing, Defragmenting, Partitioning, Cloning and Data Recovery. There are many great tools to do these functions, but to use them you either need a second operating system installed or a bunch of bootable discs. To make your life easier I have compiled a bootable image which contains as many of these tools as possible. This image can be burnt to a DVD or cloned to a iPod/flash USB stick/hard drive/partition; the resulting product will then be bootable. Bootable Utilities Image(BUI) is entirely universal--meaning it will work with intel and PPC macintosh computers--it is also entirely Leopard compatible. Note that the image now runs Leopard (10.5.3).\n\nWhats included?\nBoomerang 1.1.5 \nCarbon Copy Cloner 3.1 \nClone X 3.1.0 \nCopyCatX 4.0 \nData Rescue II 1.2.1 {58}  \nDisk Utility 11.1 {252.3}  \nDiskWarrior 4.1  \nDrive Genius 2.0.3 {1571}  \nFileSalvage 6.1.5  \nFirmware Password Utility 1.4.3 {1}\niDefrag 1.6.5 {224.5}  \niPartition 3.0.1 {142}  \nMacForensicsLab 2.5.3  \nMemTest 4.2\nOfficeSalvage 6.1.5  \nRescuePRO 3.3.0.0 {3.3}  \nSpeedTools 2.8 {2.4.2}  \nStartup Disk 1.4 {56} \nTechTool Pro 4.6.1\nTerminal 2.0.1 {240}\nTextEdit 1.5 {244}\nVolumeWorks 1.5\t\n\n{}=Build numbers where applicable.\n\n\nHOW TO USE IT:\nThere are two basic options when it comes to using this image. 1)Burn it to a DVD. 2)Run it from a hard drive(partition, flash, iPod...) I believe there has been a common misconception that this image was intended to be mounted then run from your working installation. This will not work for most applications as they require other files to be installed. You either need to burn this to DVD or copy it to a new hard drive/partition.\n\nOption 1:\n1)Open the disk utility in /Applications/Utilities/\n2)Drag this disc image into the left part of the disk utility, somewhere under your hard drive(s). \n3)Make sure the image is \\&quot;unmounted\\&quot;. To do this, click on the image you just dragged into the disk utility on the left side. At the very top, if the button furthest to the right says \\&quot;eject\\&quot;, click on it. Otherwise you are good to go.\n4)Insert your blank DVD.\n5)At the very top left of the disk utility windows click \\&quot;burn\\&quot;. Make sure \\&quot;Verify burned data\\&quot; is selected. Then click \\&quot;burn\\&quot;\n6)Restart your computer while holding down the \\&quot;c\\&quot; key. This will cause your computer to boot from whatever is in the cd drive. \n7)Wait. It will take a while to boot up. Anywhere from 5-15 minutes depending on your machine.\n8)Use the tools on the disc. They don\\&amp;#039;t really have any help or instructions, but they should be pretty straight forward.\n9)When you are done open StartupDisk and make sure the operating system/hard drive you want to boot from is selected, then hit \\&quot;restart\\&quot;.\n~If upon restarting your computer doesn\\&amp;#039;t boot up from your hard drive, try restarting while holding down the \\&quot;option\\&quot; key. This will give you a list of bootable devices to restart from. Simply select your hard drive, then click the forward pointing arrow.\nYou can also hold down your mouse, or eject button(depending on your mac) to eject the DVD while starting up.\n\nOption 2:\nIf you can boot up from a hard drive instead of a DVD I recommend it. You will find that things are much faster this way. Also, if you are planning on running this off any disk of reasonable size, I would suggest that you simply install OS X and all these tool on there. They will function more flawlessly and you will be able to multitask while optimizing or repairing your drive.\nSee option 2.1 for iPods.\n1)Open the disk utility in /Applications/Utilities/\n2)Drag this disc image into the left part of the disk utility, somewhere under your hard drive(s).\n3)Make sure the image is \\&quot;unmounted\\&quot;. To do this, click on the image you just dragged into the disk utility on the left side. At the very top, if the button furthest to the right says \\&quot;eject\\&quot;, click on it. Otherwise you are good to go.\n4)Click on the \\&quot;Restore\\&quot; tab. It is the one furthest to the right in the main part of the disk utility window.\n5)Drag the this disc image into the \\&quot;Source:\\&quot; field. You should see a green plus sign next to your cursor when it is ready to be dropped.\n6)Attach your hard drive to the computer if it isn\\&amp;#039;t already.\n7)Drag your hard drive or partition from the left part of the disk utility window to the \\&quot;Destination:\\&quot; field. Again you should see a green plus sign.\n7.5)It has  been brought to my attention that for some hard drive types, you may need to format the drive differently depending on what type of computer you plan to use this with. For intel you must do a \\&quot;GUID partition table\\&quot;, for PPC you need \\&quot;Apple Partition Map\\&quot;. To format a disk, click on the \\&quot;Erase\\&quot; tab, then on \\&quot;Options\\&quot; to access these advanced options.\n8)Now click \\&quot;Restore\\&quot;. You may want to either erase the drive/partition first, or enable the \\&quot;Erase Destination\\&quot; box.\n9)Restart your computer while holding down the \\&quot;option\\&quot; key. It might take a little while to index your bootable devices. When possible, select the device that we just restored this image too. Then click the forward arrow. It might take slightly longer than normal to start up.\n9b)If you would prefer, you may go to \\&quot;Startup Disk\\&quot; in the \\&quot;System Preferences\\&quot; and select the drive you just installed this image onto.\n9.5)Word on the street is that to get your iMac G5 to boot from usb flashdrive, go to your open firmware and type: boot ud:3,\\\\\\\\:tbxi\n10)Use the tools on the disc. They don\\&amp;#039;t really have any help or instructions, but they should be pretty straight forward.\n11a)For some reason, it seems as the the restart function in the Startup Disk application is working all of a sudden.  If it works for you, great. Otherwise, read on.\n11b)When you are done you may launch the \\&quot;Startup Disk\\&quot; application to select which disk you would like to startup from. Note that the restart function of Startup Disk doesn\\&amp;#039;t work. You will need to next open the terminal and type: \\&quot;reboot now\\&quot; ~ without the quotes.\n~If upon restarting your computer doesn\\&amp;#039;t boot up from your hard drive, try restarting while holding down the \\&quot;option\\&quot; key. This will give you a list of bootable devices to restart from. Simply select your hard drive, then click the forward pointing arrow.\nOption 2.1:\nSupposedly you can use a program called DasBoot with iPods to copy the tools over while leaving the iPod usable as a music player. I haven\\&amp;#039;t tested this option yet. If someone wants to report back to me I would be happy to post something.\n\n\nCOMMENTS:\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¥You should always read the compatibly reports for a program before using it. Not all of these tools support all macs.\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¥Don\\&amp;#039;t try to launch or quit \\&quot;QuickerPicker\\&quot;.\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¥Boomerang probably wont be registerd for you. The main reason for that is that there is no good registration laying around these days. I did leave it on there because it should be fully functional and if you happen to have your own copy of Boomerang than you should be able to enter your information.\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¥If you are going to run this from a hard drive and you have an additional 128MB of free space beyond what you need for the files on here, I would advise the you use it to appease TechTool Pro. If you don\\&amp;#039;t you should still be able to use it just fine.\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¥I plan to release periodic updates as I change various important parts of the image. However, I find it unlikely that I will release and update of this entire image just because a new program update came out. I do highly advise that you download all program updates and install them. Most of them are pretty straight forward, or you can read \\&quot;For Those Who Care\\&quot; to see what individual files you need for any one program. Also, I will probably post any information of this kind at http://www.dostuffright.com/BUI\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¥Questions, comments, suggestions, ideas and complaints are all very welcome. Please read the \\&quot;For Those Who Care\\&quot; before contacting me though. I may answer your question in there.\n\nYou are more than welcome to modify and/or redistribute this image in part or in whole. Just keep in mind that I spent an obscene amount working on this. I also used things that other people spent a long time on. So remember to give credit where credits due.\n\nPassword: d165eca57057a6b177e242fea6985dab","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dee5df9b5b47a3b36e5133988f71a47c80554412","amp;dn":"Bootable+Utilities+Image+2.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dee5df9b5b47a3b36e5133988f71a47c80554412","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,229,223,155,91,71,163,179,110,81,51,152,143,113,164,124,128,85,68,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
