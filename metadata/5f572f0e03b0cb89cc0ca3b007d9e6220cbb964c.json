Native of Texas, he was placed in charge of his many younger siblings on the death of his mother and decided to join the military at the age of 18 to provide for them. His many acts of bravery and heroism during the US military advance through Italy, France and into Germany earn him increasing rank and responsibility as well as the respect of his comrades in arms. Eventually he receives two dozen of the highest medals the US and France can bestow, culminating in the awarding of the Congressional Medal of Honor. \n\n\n\nGreetings Realuploads","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f572f0e03b0cb89cc0ca3b007d9e6220cbb964c","amp;dn":"To+Hell+and+Back+1955+%28+Nordic+subs+%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f572f0e03b0cb89cc0ca3b007d9e6220cbb964c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,87,47,14,3,176,203,137,204,12,163,176,7,217,230,34,12,187,150,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
