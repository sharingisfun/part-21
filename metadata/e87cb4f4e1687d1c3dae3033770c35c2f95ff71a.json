They didn't speak to one another again for something over 20 years. Tull went on to be megastars; Blodwyn Pig made a couple of albums and ran out of steam.\n\n&quot;Ahead Rings Out&quot; was the first Pig album and as well as one of the best album covers ever, it also has some great songs based on heavy blues/rock riffs. With Abrahams on guitar and the remarkable Jack Lancaster on sax, Blodwyn Pig had a sound that has its roots in 60s R&amp;B, but that no other band at the time could match.\n\nTurn the stereo up loud and try &quot;Its Only Love&quot;, &quot;Sing Me A Song That I Know&quot; and &quot;Aint'Ya Coming Home Babe&quot;. And, I can't remember which track it's on, but try to ignore the rather feeble attempt at humour, which detracts from an otherwise classic album.\n\nhttp://www.mickaby.freeola.com/\nhttp://www.chromeoxide.com/blodwyn.htm\n\nartwork included\n\nenjoy \n\n|papy|\n.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e87cb4f4e1687d1c3dae3033770c35c2f95ff71a","amp;dn":"Blodwyn+Pig+-+Ahead+Rings+Out+%281969%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e87cb4f4e1687d1c3dae3033770c35c2f95ff71a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,124,180,244,225,104,125,28,61,174,48,51,119,12,53,194,249,95,247,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
