Overseas, their drones have been used by the military for years Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and itÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s meant billions for OmniCorpÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s bottom line. Now OmniCorp wants to bring their controversial technology to the home front, and they see a golden opportunity to do it. When Alex Murphy (Joel Kinnaman) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a loving husband, father and good cop doing his best to stem the tide of crime and corruption in Detroit Ã¢â‚¬â€œ is critically injured in the line of duty, OmniCorp sees their chance for a part-man, part-robot police officer.
