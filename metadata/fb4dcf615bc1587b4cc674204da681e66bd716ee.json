I have uploaded this as my first torrent, to showcase the talent of a new, up-and-coming band called Ãƒâ€ ther Realm. They're made up of some personal friends of mine, and I've uploaded this in hopes of spreading their name, as well as their music.\n\nThis is an upload of their most recent album, &quot;One Chosen by the Gods&quot;, which they released for purchase very recently, here: http://aetherrealm.storefrontier.com/\n\nThat is also their official merch store. PLEASE BUY THEIR STUFF. It's awesome. I have the blue shirt.\n\nThey're primarily a Viking-style Melodic-Deathmetal band, which means fast, pounding drums,  heavy guitar shredding with sweeping orchestral backing, and harsh, powerful vocals.\n\nTheir Lineup: \nVincent Jones - Vocals, Orchestrals, Bass\nHeinrich Arnold - Guitars\nJack Rodriguez-Dougherty - Guitars\nTyler Gresham - Drums\n\nTheir Facebook: .com/AetherRealm\n\nIf people ask, I'll upload the lyrics. \n\nTrack information is already set on the files.\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb4dcf615bc1587b4cc674204da681e66bd716ee","amp;dn":"%26AElig%3Bther+Realm%3A+One+Chosen+by+the+Gods","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb4dcf615bc1587b4cc674204da681e66bd716ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,77,207,97,91,193,88,123,76,198,116,32,77,166,129,230,107,215,22,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
