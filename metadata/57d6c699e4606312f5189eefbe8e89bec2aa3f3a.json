A prominent underlying thesis of the Film Series is that a great many notions, beliefs and practices currently engaged in today and assumed as \\\\\\&quot;presupposed\\\\\\&quot;, \\\\\\&quot;given\\\\\\&quot; or seemingly empirical to our societal approaches and values are not only intellectually/historically incorrect but highly detrimental to our personal and social progress and sustainability. Zeitgeist: Moving Forward focuses on the very fabric of the social order: Monetary-Market Economics. While the majority of the world today have slowly come to see some basic flaws in the economic system we share, as large scale debt defaults, inflation, industrial pollution, resource depletion, rising cancer rates and other signposts emerge to bring the concern into the realm of \\\\\\&quot;public health\\\\\\&quot; overall, very few however consider the economic paradigm as a whole as the source. The tendency is to demand reform in one area or another, avoiding the possibility that perhaps the entire system is intrinsically flawed at the foundational level. ZMF presents the case that it is, indeed, the very foundational mechanics of this system that generates the patterns of behavior and unsustainable methods of conduct that are leading to the vast spectrum of detrimental consequences both personal, social, and environmental and the longer they go on, the worse things will become. www.zeitgeistmovingforward.com ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:57d6c699e4606312f5189eefbe8e89bec2aa3f3a","amp;dn":"Zeitgeist.Moving.Forward-DVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"57d6c699e4606312f5189eefbe8e89bec2aa3f3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,214,198,153,228,96,99,18,245,24,158,239,190,142,137,190,194,170,63,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
