Having travelled back and forth to Bamako, then unveiled the magic of their coming together in a live premiere commissioned by the Aldeburgh Music organisation in Suffolk, the award-winning pianist and composer set about recording this album with the help of a private investor. Who then promptly pulled out.\n\nThat this quite gorgeous disc is now seeing the light of day is testament to Wilson's belief that he was on to something special. Featuring an additional cast of horn players and percussionists, and guest vocalists including the jelimuso, or griot, Kandia KouyatÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©, Mali Latino shimmers and shoulder-shakes its way through 12 varied and consistently excellent tracks. Wilson has previously explored links between soul and gospel to East Indian and Brazilian styles; with Mali Latino he takes jazz and Latin rhythms back to their African roots while still sounding dynamic and modern. Opener 'Donkan' sets the pace: a rollicking dance tune featuring sublime balafon playing, cascading kora and urgent brass, framed by clever arrangements. Aoua KassÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Mady DiabatÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©, daughter of legendary griot singer KassÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Mady DiabatÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© lends her sweet pipes to 'Sangre Mandinga'. 'Bomba Bambara', meanwhile, sees a host of wonderful African voices vying and blending, book-ended by Wilson's inspired piano. The effort, then, has paid off. Wilson has crafted a classic.\n-- SongLines\n\nMali Latino is led by:\nMadou Sidiki DiabatÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©\nAhmed Fofana\nAlex Wilson\n\nTrack List\n01 - Donkan\n02 - Sangre Mandinga\n03 - Ankaben\n04 - Voyage\n05 - Bamako 2000\n06 - Joie au Village\n07 - Ni Koh Bedy\n08 - Ankan Tolon\n09 - Kansala\n10 - Bomba Bambara\n11 - Oiaymelo\n12 - Remercier les Travailleurs\n\nArtwork, EAC log and CUE sheet included.\n\nAudio format: FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://flac.sourceforge.net/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://flac.sourceforge.net/index.html&lt;/a&gt; \n\nEnjoy, seed and inhale!\nLegalise it!\n\nPastafariCubensis &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:548fde8f7883b18dbbe38c735c0f57d8013c7c3d","amp;dn":"Mali+Latino+%5BFLAC%5D+TQMP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"548fde8f7883b18dbbe38c735c0f57d8013c7c3d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,143,222,143,120,131,177,141,187,227,140,115,92,15,87,216,1,60,124,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
