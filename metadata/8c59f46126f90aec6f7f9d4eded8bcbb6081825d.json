Primarily a strategy game, it straddles several sub-genres and so weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve resorted to describing it as a Ã¢â‚¬Ëœplanetary defence simulatorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. The player is in control of an organisation tasked with defending the planet against extraterrestrial invasion; establishing bases across the world that house the aircraft, scientists, technicians and soldiers that will be used to protect humanity. The skies must be defended against alien incursion, while ground teams must be sent into combat to capture crashed UFOs or cleanse terror sites to retain the confidence of funding nations and capture new extraterrestrial artefacts and technology to study. As the game goes on, the player researches the captured artefacts to unlock new units and battlefield technology to use in the fight against the aliens while slowly discovering their origins, eventually learning enough to defeat the alien invasion Ã¢â‚¬â€œ assuming that they have not already been overrun!\n\nThis is a small update to Hotfix 1, fixing a few remaining issues within Hotfix 1:\n\n- A crash associated with destroyed alien bases spawning invalid supply missions is fixed\n- Valkyrie spawn maps are no longer comprised of black tiles that units cannot walk on\n- Sebillian Guards no longer incorrectly spawn in the Light Scout ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c59f46126f90aec6f7f9d4eded8bcbb6081825d","amp;dn":"Xenonauts+V20+HF2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c59f46126f90aec6f7f9d4eded8bcbb6081825d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,89,244,97,38,249,10,236,111,127,157,78,222,216,188,187,96,129,130,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
