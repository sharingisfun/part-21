Based on the out of print book What Was The First Rock n Roll Record? By Jim Dawson and Steve Propes, with an editorial cue from The Guardian and a host of online message boards, this intoxicating mix of styles add up to the birth of rock n roll. From the first use of the word rock, to the hybrid of rocking and rolling, every track tells a story at the count down to the end of the '50s. The first release on Famous Flames, The First Rock And Roll Record is an extensive collection that traces the very roots of the term rock n roll. It began, we believe, at a religious camp meeting in 1916, before travelling far and wide and stealing from everyone.
