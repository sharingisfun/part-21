The show was created by Tom Grieves. Inspired by the real life &quot;Ghost Squad&quot; that existed between 1994 and 1998, secretly investigating police corruption, the premise of the series is that the squad continued to operate in secret after officially being shut down. It starred Elaine Cassidy as a police constable recruited into the squad and Jonas Armstrong as her handler. The show was canceled after a single seven episode series.\n\nCreated by Tom Grieves.\n\nWith Elaine Cassidy, Emma Fielding, Jonas Armstrong, James Weber Brown.\n\nNOTE: Upload for   &quot;historical&quot; reasons only - back then my first torrents of TV series. Ripped again to today's standards, BUT - anyone can see how bad was Channel 4 in terms of video quality (yes, DVD is ugly, buy, get, rent one if you find hard to believe).\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8b85b9620e51eb764dd08458367b99cc5874c59","amp;dn":"The.Ghost.Squad.2005.Complete.DVDRip.576p.H264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8b85b9620e51eb764dd08458367b99cc5874c59","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,184,91,150,32,229,30,183,100,221,8,69,131,103,185,156,197,135,76,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
