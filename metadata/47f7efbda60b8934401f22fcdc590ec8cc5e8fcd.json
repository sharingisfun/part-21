Titans are typically several stories tall, seem to have no intelligence, devour human beings and, worst of all, seem to do it for the pleasure rather than as a food source. A small percentage of humanity survived by walling themselves in a city protected by extremely high walls, even taller than the biggest of titans.\n\nFlash forward to the present and the city has not seen a titan in over 100 years. Teenage boy Eren Jaegar (YÃƒÂ»ki Kaji) and his foster sister Mikasa Ackerman (Yui Ishikawa) witness something horrific as the city walls are destroyed by a colossal titan that appears out of thin air.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47f7efbda60b8934401f22fcdc590ec8cc5e8fcd","amp;dn":"Attack+on+Titan+Episode+01-+12+720p+Engsub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47f7efbda60b8934401f22fcdc590ec8cc5e8fcd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,247,239,189,166,11,137,52,64,31,34,252,220,89,14,200,204,94,143,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
