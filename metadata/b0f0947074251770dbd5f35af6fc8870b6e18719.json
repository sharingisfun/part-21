They chat about a smorgasbord of topics like the way the media is currently handling Ebola, AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fascination with disasters, rats in New York, bear killers, and serial killers. The boys also discuss QuinnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s SNL days, assassinations, drug smugglers, and low and behold, they actually get a half decent phone call that comes along with a crazy story. Dani Golightly sits in to yap about her phone being stolen, we watch a Phil Robertson sermon on gay marriage, Colin gets a new drink (as we all wait with baited breath) and then god only know why but, they take some more phone calls. Ant brings up a news story about Apple pulling a sex app, one about Al SharptonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lawyer, and one on Jimmy Carter. They end the show talking about the Ã¢â‚¬Å“no vag orgasm,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Cary Grant receiving LSD therapy, and weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re treated to a special phone call from Chipper and Uncle Paul.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0f0947074251770dbd5f35af6fc8870b6e18719","amp;dn":"TACS+-+The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2014-10-08","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0f0947074251770dbd5f35af6fc8870b6e18719","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,240,148,112,116,37,23,112,219,213,243,90,246,252,136,112,182,225,135,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
