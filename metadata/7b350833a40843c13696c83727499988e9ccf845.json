The group had a number of worldwide and UK hits during the 1980s and 1990s, and have sold more than 31 million albums worldwide[1].\n\nThe band gained fame for its high calibre musicianship, especially that of Mark King, whose percussive slap bass guitar technique provided the driving groove of many of the band&amp;#039;s hits. They are also known for the combination of King&amp;#039;s lead vocals and keyboard player Mike Lindup&amp;#039;s falsetto backing vocals. After originally disbanding in 1994, the band reformed in 2001.\n\n\nFull Album @ 320kbps\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b350833a40843c13696c83727499988e9ccf845","amp;dn":"Level+42+-+Level+Best","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b350833a40843c13696c83727499988e9ccf845","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,53,8,51,164,8,67,193,54,150,200,55,39,73,153,136,233,204,248,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
