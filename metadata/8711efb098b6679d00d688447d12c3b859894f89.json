Xanadu &amp; Sweet Lady - Rapper's Delight \n7. Carol Cool - Upside Down \n8. One Blood - Be Thankful \n\n\n\n&quot;Hustle ! Reggae Disco&quot; from the London based Soul Jazz Records crew is a smasher \ncollection of reggae interpretations of classic disco tunes. As Lovers Rock and \nRare Groove met in London in the 1980s, these disco reggae tracks are mix of UK \nartists such as the Blood Sisters, Carol Cool, Family Choice and Black Harmony and \nJamaican artists and DJs such as Kingston's Derrick Laro and Trinity, Xanadu and \nSweet Lady. The originals are Anita Ward's &quot;Ring My Bell&quot;, Chaka Khan's &quot;I'm Every Woman&quot;, \nMichael Jackson's &quot;Don't Stop Till You Get Enough&quot;, Jean Carn's &quot;Don't Let It Go To Your Head&quot;, \nThe Whisper's &quot;And The Beat Goes On&quot;, Sugarhill Gang &quot;Rapper's Delight&quot;, Diana Ross &quot;Upside Down&quot;\n, and William De Vaughn's &quot;Be Thankful&quot;. This overlooked set of twelve inch disco killers \nfeatures awesome versions such as One Blood's Be Thankful For What You've Got, the Blood Sisters \nwith Ring My Bell, complete with a great drum'n' bass version and Black Harmony with \nDon't Let It Go To Your Head. Producer Joe Gibbs delivers two tracks here, which are withouth doubt \nthe most impudent covers we've ever heard. The combination Xanadu and Sweet Lady bring Rapper's \nDelight, a track by the Sugarhill Gang, that was originally inspired by Jamaican toasters and the\nMichael Jackson cover Don't Stop 'Till You Get Enough which is brought to you by Derrick Laro \n(Lara ?) and the deejay Trinity. \nShameless, cheap, but interesting enough to check out !\n\n\n\nEnjoyyyy and Seed .","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8711efb098b6679d00d688447d12c3b859894f89","amp;dn":"Various+Artists+-+Hustle+%40+320+kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8711efb098b6679d00d688447d12c3b859894f89","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,17,239,176,152,182,103,157,0,214,136,68,125,18,195,184,89,137,79,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
