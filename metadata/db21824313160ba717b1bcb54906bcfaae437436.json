The sound, a result of the integration of psychedelic/progressive rock and elements of contemporary art such as architecture and visual arts influenced by bands like PINK FLOYD, BEATLES, GONG and many others.Psychedelic rock band lined-up in 1984 in Sao Paulo, they started making a reputation in the underground scene in the next year, when they recorded a demo tape with the songs &quot;Outono&quot;, &quot;Dia Eterno&quot;, &quot;Declinio de Maio&quot; and &quot;Reflexos da Noite&quot;. The tape got heavy rotation on alternative radio stations in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. In 1986, they recorded a three-track EP on Wop Bop Discos and signed up to RCA (currently BMG) in 1987, releasing the debut album &quot;Violeta de Outono&quot;. After the package named &quot;The Early Years&quot; (comprised of a cassette tape, a EP and a libretto), the follow-up album, &quot;Em Toda Parte&quot;, came about in 1989. In 1991, vocalist and guitarist Fabio Golfetti left the band to\ndedicate to the instrumental project Opera Invisivel, releasing a solo album, &quot;Glissando Spirit&quot;, two years later on the label Low Life. VIOLETA made a comeback in 1994, recording new demo tapes and a new album, but they ended up releasing &quot;Eclipse&quot;, with live recordings from 1986. The album with new songs, &quot;Mulher na Montanha&quot;, was released in 1999 on the English label Voiceprint, featuring recordings made four years before.The Early Years collects material recorded in April and May 1988, before Brazilian progressive rock outfit VIOLETA DE OUTONO released its first album. The five tracks on this CD are covers of psychedelic/prog songs. Included are the ROLLING STONES, PINK FLOYD, GONG,&quot; George Harrison and a medley of FLOYD and LED ZEPPELIN. Interpretations are also quite average and stay close to the originals. This CD is clearly for the fan or the collector of South American prog/psych music.\nÃÂ ÃÂ°ÃÂ·ÃÂ±ÃÂ¸ÃÂ²ÃÂºÃÂ° ÃÂ½ÃÂ° ÃÂ³ÃÂ»ÃÂ°ÃÂ²Ã‘â€¹ ÃÂ¿ÃÂ¾ Ã‘â€šÃ‘â‚¬ÃÂµÃÂºÃÂ°ÃÂ¼: ÃÂµÃ‘ï¿½Ã‘â€šÃ‘Å’\nÃÅ¡ÃÂ°Ã‘â€¡ÃÂµÃ‘ï¿½Ã‘â€šÃÂ²ÃÂ¾ : DVD5\nÃÂ¤ÃÂ¾Ã‘â‚¬ÃÂ¼ÃÂ°Ã‘â€š: DVD video\nÃâ€™ÃÂ¸ÃÂ´ÃÂµÃÂ¾ ÃÂºÃÂ¾ÃÂ´ÃÂµÃÂº: MPEG2\nÃï¿½Ã‘Æ’ÃÂ´ÃÂ¸ÃÂ¾ ÃÂºÃÂ¾ÃÂ´ÃÂµÃÂº: PCM\nÃâ€™ÃÂ¸ÃÂ´ÃÂµÃÂ¾: NTSC 4:3 (720x480) VBR\nÃï¿½Ã‘Æ’ÃÂ´ÃÂ¸ÃÂ¾: Not specified, LPCM, Delay = 0 mSec ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db21824313160ba717b1bcb54906bcfaae437436","amp;dn":"Violeta+De+Outono+Seventh+Brings+Return+A+Tribute+To+Syd+Barrett","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db21824313160ba717b1bcb54906bcfaae437436","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,33,130,67,19,22,11,167,23,177,188,181,73,6,188,250,174,67,116,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
