This extraordinary story of the last soldier to be executed by the Canadian military -- likely wrongfully -- gives life to the forgotten casualties of war and brings their honour home at last.\n\nHarold Pringle was underage when the Second World War broke out, eager to leave quiet Flinton, Ontario, to serve by his fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s side. But few who volunteered to fight Ã¢â‚¬Å“the good fightÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ realized what horror lay ahead; soon Pringle found himself in Italy, fighting on the bloody Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hitler Line,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ where two-thirds of his company were killed. Shell-shocked, he embarked on a tragic, final course that culminated in a suspect murder conviction.\n\nHis appeal was reviewed by the highest levels of government, right up to prime minister King. But Private Pringle was put to death -- the only soldier the Canadians executed in the whole of the Second World War. His own countrymen carried out the orders, forbidden to go home before completing this last grotesque assignment, even though the war had ended. The Pringle file was closed and stayed that way for fifty years -- until Andrew Clark uncovered it and began a two-year investigation on PringleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life in the army.\n\nA Keen Soldier is a true-life military detective story that shows another side of what many consider our proudest military campaign. Andrew Clark examines the fallout of a crisis that disfigured our national conscience and continues to raise questions about the ethics of war. And he does so with eloquence and a deep compassion, not only for his subject but for all wartime soldiers -- even the men who executed Pringle and the officer who gave the order to fire.\n\nGenre: Biography, History, Military, WW2","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22aa47eb4a2877b0b65ef8aab86a9391b0f557f7","amp;dn":"A+Keen+Soldier+by+Andrew+Clark","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22aa47eb4a2877b0b65ef8aab86a9391b0f557f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,170,71,235,74,40,119,176,182,94,248,170,184,106,147,145,176,245,87,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
