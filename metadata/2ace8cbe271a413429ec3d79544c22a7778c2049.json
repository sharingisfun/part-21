The Bear family has run out of honey, and Father Bear and Small Bear are sent to get more. But rather than just get some at the store as Mother Bear suggested, Father Bear decides to follow a bee and get fresh honey from the source. Early readers and established Berenstain Bears fans will lap up this sweet, adventurous (and misadventurous) tale.\n\nOriginally created by Dr. Seuss, Beginner Books encourage children to read all by themselves, with simple words and illustrations that give clues to their meaning. \n\n\nGenre: Childrens","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ace8cbe271a413429ec3d79544c22a7778c2049","amp;dn":"The+Big+Honey+Hunt+-+Stan+%26amp%3B+Jan+Berenstain+%5BEpub+%26amp%3B+Mobi%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ace8cbe271a413429ec3d79544c22a7778c2049","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,206,140,190,39,26,65,52,41,236,61,121,84,76,34,167,119,140,32,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
