I arrived and picked up front row loge seats which is a great spot\r\nto record.  Van Morrison put on a great performance and the recording does it\r\njustice.  Great crowd except the asshats behind me who talked most of the show.  \r\nFortunately I could lean forward which meant I didn't need to listen to them.  \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nJust the basic taper requests here and please no vitriol:\r\nDon't be an ass by selling this or using it in a video that is sold\r\nDon't modify the info file\r\nDon't remaster and/or post on other sites that are not 100% free \r\nIf shared keep info file intact but create a second file with any changes\r\nDon't convert to lossy formats except for personal use\r\nDo support the artists","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ccc87d9f4575241c4cac4459866fe4e00ef82b81","amp;dn":"Van+Morrison+-+2016-01-18+-+Oakland+Ca+US","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ccc87d9f4575241c4cac4459866fe4e00ef82b81","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,200,125,159,69,117,36,28,76,172,68,89,134,111,228,224,14,248,43,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
