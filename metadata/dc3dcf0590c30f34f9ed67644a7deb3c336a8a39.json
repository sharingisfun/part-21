Sinatra's first collaboration with arranger/conductor Billy May, Come Fly With Me was designed as a musical trip around the world. Sammy Cahn and Jimmy Van Heusen wrote the title track at Sinatra*s request.\n\nIn all honesty, the cover of Come Fly With Me is enough to get you to purchase the album. Who can resist the image of Frank, standing against the backdrop of a clear blue sky, sporting his trademark tilted hat and fine pressed tux, a sly look in his eye, inviting you to take his hand and take to the sky to *get away from it all.*\n\nOf course, there*s more to Come Fly With Me than beautiful artwork, as the music is just as much, if not more beautiful and equally warm and inviting. Frank*s sixth(!) album recorded in 1957, Come Fly With Me was Frank*s first collaboration with Billy May. Whereas Gordon Jenkins (who worked with Frank for the first time earlier in the year on the woefully underrated Where Are You?) specialized in moody, string driven ballads, and the legendary Nelson Riddle represented somewhat of a middle ground between lushly orchestrated ballads and heavy swingers, Billy May mastered big, loud, brassy numbers. The result was a fatter, fuller sound than previous efforts that nonetheless suited Frank*s style to a T.\n\nThe album begins with its timeless title track, a breezy Cahn-Van Huesen composition that features a soaring Frank vocal and elegant, propulsive May chart that shoots down any doubt about how well the duo's collaboration would turn out. This song alone makes the album worth the ticket price.\n\nThe rest of the album is excellent. *Around The World*, *Moonlight In Vermont,* and especially the stunning *Autumn In New York* (one of Frank*s most delicate and powerful vocal performances) all show May could handle a ballad (something some doubted due to the generally swinging nature of his music). *Lets Get Away From It All* is charming and fun, as are *Isle Of Capri* and the thrilling *On The Road To Mandalay*. *April In Paris* has some of Frank*s best singing, stretching his vocal range to new heigts and putting great emphasis on his legato. *London By Night* goes down ever so smoothly, while *Brazil* swings gently. *Blue Hawaii* never sounded this beautiful when Elvis did it, and lastly, *Its Nice To Go Travling is a perfect closer and a true gem of a song.\n\nCome Fly With Me is classic Frank the whole way through, a light as the breeze masterpiece that only Frank can provide.\n\nIn his autobiography *All You Need is Ears*, famed producer George Martin writes of having visited the Capitol Tower during the recording sessions for the album. According to Martin*s book, Sinatra expressed intense dislike for the album cover upon being first shown a mock-up, suggesting it looked like an advertisement for TWA.\n\n*On the Road to Mandalay*, based on Rudyard Kipling*s poem Mandalay was replaced on some versions of the album after the Kipling family objected to Sinatra*s interpretation. When the album was initially released in the United Kingdom, the song *French Foreign Legion* replaced *Mandalay*, while the song *Chicago* (and *It Happened in Monterey* on some pressings) were used in other parts of theCommonwealth. Sinatra sang the song in Australia, during a concert tour in 1959, and relayed the story of the Kipling family objection to the song and how the Australian release of Come Fly with Me came to contain *Chicago*.\n\nThe album reached #1 on the Billboard album chart in its second week, and remained at the top for five weeks. At the inaugural Grammy Awards Come Fly with Me was nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year.\n\nThough recorded in true stereo, Come Fly With Me was released to record stores in 1958 in monaural only; a standard practice by Capitol records at the time. The label finally released the stereo version in 1962. The differences between the 1958 monaural and subsequent 1962 stereo recording of Come Fly With Me are striking. Some view the 1958 mono recording as having a depth and warmth, most especially in specific string and brass sections, which is lacking in the stereo remix of the album released by Capitol as SW-920 in 1962. While all Capitol CDs reproduce only the 1962 stereo version, the newly released (November, 2009) 180 gram LP reissue from Capitol, although bearing the cover, sleeve, label, and catalog number (SW-920) of the stereo issue, is, in fact, a re-issue of the original mono mix, now available (perhaps by error on the part of Capitol Records, LLC) for the first time in over 40 years. (In December 2009, the recent LP release was officially recalled by Capitol Records, citing the fact it was a mono LP packaged in the stereo sleeve.\n\n\n\nTrack Listing\n\n1.
