The game also features several battle modes for single-player and multiplayer gameplay.\n\nThe game is set in the desertous region of Orre. The player protagonist is Wes, a former member of Team Snagem. Throughout the game, the player rescues &quot;Shadow PokÃƒÂ©mon&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€PokÃƒÂ©mon who have had their hearts darkened by Cipher, an antagonistic organizationÃ¢â‚¬â€via snagging. Rui, a non-player girl, serves as Wes's sidekick and identifies Shadow PokÃƒÂ©mon.\n\nPokÃƒÂ©mon Colosseum was exhibited at Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) 2003. Pre-orders were packaged with a bonus disc that allows the player to download the PokÃƒÂ©mon Jirachi. Upon release, the game was generally well-received, with praise directed at its graphics and mixed comments at issues such as level design and music. It was a commercial success, with 1.5 million copies sold in the United States and 656,270 in Japan.\n\nÃ‚Â¡TESTED ON DIOS MIOS!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7af8156c9edb9f95ae24ccab2bb5f39e80066b2c","amp;dn":"Pokemon+Colosseum+%5BENGLISH%5D+%5BNTSC-USA%5D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7af8156c9edb9f95ae24ccab2bb5f39e80066b2c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,248,21,108,158,219,159,149,174,36,204,171,43,181,243,158,128,6,107,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
