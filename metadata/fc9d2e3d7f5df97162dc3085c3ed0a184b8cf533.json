J. Night\n\nEmily Hunter loves hanging out with her new neighbors. From their decked-out rec room to their almost-professional guitar playing, Drew and Vicky Strig are super cool.\n\nThe only bummer is that Drew and Vicky are homeschooled and Emily's other friends haven't gotten to know them yet. So Emily comes up with a plan for everyone to meet--a big party and sleepover at her house!\n\nBut as Emily gets ready for the party, she begins to wonder about Drew and Vicky. They won't let Emily into certain rooms in their house. And a wolf howls on their lawn every night. Is it only Emily's overactive imagination or are the new neighbors more than just a little strange?\n\n*************************\nAge Range: 8 - 12 years\nGrade Level: 3 - 7\nSeries: You're invited to a Creepover (Book 2)\nPaperback: 160 pages\nPublisher: Simon Spotlight; Original edition (June 7, 2011)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 9781442420953\nISBN-13: 978-1442420953\n\n\nAbout the Author\n\nA lifelong night owl, P.J. Night often works furiously into the wee hours of the morning, writing down spooky tales and dreaming up new stories of the supernatural and otherworldly.
