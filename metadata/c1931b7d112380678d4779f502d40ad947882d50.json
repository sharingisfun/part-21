I have about 3 years worth and will scan and post them in chronological order (thats the order that they were published for you who have problems reading big words)\n\nThis is a PDF file and contains all articles, reviews and tutorials. Full page advertisements have been left out to save time and space (This particular issue was about 1/3 ads).\n\nThe tutorials may be somewhat dated, but most are still useful for an introduction to using Lightwave. If anyone is in need of a particular issue, I will on request, get it done as soon as possible.\n\nPlease Seed, and leave comments if you find this torrent useful.\n\n--\nHieraco","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1931b7d112380678d4779f502d40ad947882d50","amp;dn":"VTU_+06-07-1992.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c1931b7d112380678d4779f502d40ad947882d50","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,147,27,125,17,35,128,103,141,71,121,245,2,212,10,217,71,136,45,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
