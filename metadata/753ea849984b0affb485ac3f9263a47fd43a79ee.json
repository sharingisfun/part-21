It is unfortunate. But I will at least give you titles of the episodes if they are available.\n\nSeason 6 Summary:\n\nFrom the flat plains of Norfolk to the volcanic island of Nevis in the West Indies, the Time Team dig up secrets of the past, and dispel a few myths along the way. There's also a revisit to Turkdean, the Roman villa site from the live program.\n\nEpisode   Air Date   \t    Title \t\n\n  01    03 January 1999   Burslem, Stoke On Trent - (Wedgewood's first factory)\n  02    10 January 1999   Papcastle, Cumbria\n  03    17 January 1999   Thetford, Norfolk\n  04    24 January 1999   Cheddar Gorge, Somerset - (Cooper's Hole)\n  05    31 January 1999   Plympton, Devon\n  06    07 February 1999  Smallhythe, Kent\n  07    14 February 1999  Beauport Park, East Sussex\n  08    21 February 1999  Reedham Marshes, Norfolk - (Bombers in Reedham Marshes)\n  09    28 February 1999  Turkdean, Gloucestershire - (Revisited)\n  10    07 March 1999     Kemerton, Worcestershire\n  11    14 March 1999     Bawsey, Norfolk\n  12    21 March 1999     Nevis, West Indies - Part One\n  13    28 March 1999     Nevis, West Indies - Part Two\n\nNOTE: If you are looking for High-Def videos, these are not for you.
