It covers the first 6 books of Euclid, which range through most of elementary plane geometry and the theory of proportions. What distinguishes Byrne's edition is that he attempts to present Euclid's proofs in terms of pictures, using as little text - and in particular as few labels - as possible. What makes the book especially striking is his use of colour.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.sunsite.ubc.ca/DigitalMathArchive/Euclid/byrne.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.sunsite.ubc.ca/DigitalMathArchive/Euclid/byrne.html&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10c8eb14add231d4cff1d4d6a9da52ae664e7e02","amp;dn":"euclid_byrne.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10c8eb14add231d4cff1d4d6a9da52ae664e7e02","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,200,235,20,173,210,49,212,207,241,212,214,169,218,82,174,102,78,126,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
