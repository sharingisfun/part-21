When a number of rich men come to a mysterious end, and a young investment banker dies of a supposed heart attack, FBI agent John O'Hara believes it is the work of a cold-blooded killer. Turning his eye to the only witness - the young banker's beautiful and secretive widow - O'Hara thinks he's closing in, but he's not sure whether he's pursuing justice or his own fatal obsession. This compelling edge-of -your seat thriller reads like a collaboration with Alfred Hitchcock and keeps readers guessing until the last deadly kiss.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf1b2ce7a6ef63f3e846d6a9d96f92647bb18cbb","amp;dn":"Honeymoon+by+James+Patterson","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf1b2ce7a6ef63f3e846d6a9d96f92647bb18cbb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,27,44,231,166,239,99,243,232,70,214,169,217,111,146,100,123,177,140,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
