There is also an RPG element present in card-collecting and upgrading the talents. The game is heavy on combat, which is mostly ranged, with Cain either shooting or using the psychic powers. The talents are classified into groups, such as Fire, Sun, Illusion, Science, Demonology, etc. In each group, there are many talents Cain can learn, which range from offensive and supporting combat spells to abilities needed to solve puzzles (such as levitating, pushing heavy objects, etc.)\n\nInstallation:\n1) Mount or burn game image;\n2) Install the game;\n3) Play the game with the CD, because I couldn't find a working crack.\n\nMetacritic: http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/sanity-aikens-artifact","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2bd54b4e7ac3b73ec792eb09d7b1e2d00732bf37","amp;dn":"Sanity+Aiken%5C%27s+Artifact","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2bd54b4e7ac3b73ec792eb09d7b1e2d00732bf37","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,213,75,78,122,195,183,62,199,146,235,9,215,177,226,208,7,50,191,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
