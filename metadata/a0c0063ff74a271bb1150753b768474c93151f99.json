Recorded at Philadelphia?s Grape\nStreet on February 22, 2006, the live acoustic show features hits\nfrom the band?s gold certified debut albums Disclaimer and\nDisclaimer II and their current release, the gold certified Karma\n&amp; Effect. Included on the CD are Seether?s smash hits ?Remedy? and\n?Broken.?  The final track listing also showcases some of the\nband?s most hard-rocking anthems including ?Gasoline? and ?Truth?\nin a fresh, intimate setting that provides a unique experience for\nboth new and long time fans. One Cold Night highlights Shaun\nMorgan?s heartfelt vocals and his intensity as a performer as well\nas the band?s superior musicianship.\n\nGrape Street provided a meaningful location to capture this\nspecial night with Seether.  The venue happens to be the site\nwhere guitarist Pat Callahan first met Seether?s Shaun Morgan and\nDale Stewart.  The chance meeting ultimately led to Callahan being\noffered an audition to join the band.  Singer and principal\nsongwriter Shaun Morgan recalls, ?I remember seeing Pat play at\nthe original Grape Street club and I knew I wanted him in the\nband. This was a homecoming for him and the band, per se, and\ncould not have been at another place. We are all very comfortable\nat Grape Street and have always had the feeling of family in that\nplace.?  When asked about performing his repertoire in an acoustic\nsetting, he continued, ?This is an experience for us to have some\nfun and present our music in a different fashion. It is amazing\nfor us to be able to play the same heavy songs in a more intimate\nenvironment. We love it because we feel a connection with the\naudience and they can understand and listen to every chord that\ncomes from the stage. It?s always fun to just mix it up and that&amp;#039;s\nwhat we?re all about.?\n\n?The Gift,? Seether?s current and third single from Karma &amp;\nEffect, continues to build strong radio airplay.  The song is #16\non the active rock chart this week, and climbing at modern.\nEntertainment Weekly offered, ??Morgan strikes rock-radio gold in\n&amp;#039;&amp;#039;The Gift,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; a deliciously moody ballad??  The recently completed\nmusic video for the track was shot on location in Oaxaca, Mexico\nwith director Meiert Avis.\nThe bonus DVD includes an in-depth interview with the band\nconducted by Philadelphia?s WMMR on-air legend Pierre Robert; the\nmusic video for ?The Gift,? a behind the scenes package from the\nOaxaca video shoot, and a gallery of still photos from the Grape\nStreet performance.  The set list features some rarities,\nincluding a performance of ?Tied My Hands,? a favorite from the\nband?s early days as Saron Gas, and a cover of Pearl Jam?s\n?Immortality.?\nSeether plans to tour in support of One Cold Night and will\nannounce dates soon.  The band recently completed the sold-out\nSnoCore tour which they headlined in most cities.
