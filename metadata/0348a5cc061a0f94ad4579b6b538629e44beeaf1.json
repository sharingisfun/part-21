These engineering problems occur in the course of the design and construction of hydroenergy plants, water-supply and other systems. In this book, the author presents his experience in solving these problems from the early 1970s to the present day. During this period new methods of solving hydraulic problems have evolved, due to the development of computers and numerical methods.\r\n\r\nThis book is accompanied by a website which hosts the author's software package, Simpip (an abbreviation of simulation of pipe flow) for solving non-steady pipe flow using the finite element method. The program also covers flows in channels. The book presents the numerical core of the SimpipCore program (written in Fortran).\r\n\r\nKey features:\r\n\r\nPresents the theory and practice of modelling different flows in hydraulic networks\r\nTakes a systematic approach and addresses the topic from the fundamentals\r\nPresents numerical solutions based on finite element analysis\r\nAccompanied by a website hosting supporting material including the SimpipCore project as a standalone program\r\n\r\nAnalysis and Modelling of Non-Steady Flow in Pipe and Channel Networks is an ideal reference book for engineers, practitioners and graduate students across engineering disciplines","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0348a5cc061a0f94ad4579b6b538629e44beeaf1","amp;dn":"Analysis+and+Modelling+of+Non-Steady+Flow+in+Pipe+and+Channel+Ne","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0348a5cc061a0f94ad4579b6b538629e44beeaf1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,72,165,204,6,26,15,148,173,69,121,182,181,56,98,158,68,190,234,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
