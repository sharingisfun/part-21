From there, we will\nlearn how to use effectors for controlling the behavior of clones and\nother objects, we will learn how to control the color and shading of our\nvarious clones, we will learn how to incorporate dynamics into our\nMoGraph objects, as well as many other topics that will help you to\nbecome familiar with MoGraph and give you a glimpse into some of the\ncreative possibilities this tool provides us.\n\nKeep seeding.
