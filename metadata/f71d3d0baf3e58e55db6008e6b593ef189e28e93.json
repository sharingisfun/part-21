Now Emma has it down to a T. She tosses her hair with the signature Sutton Mercer flip and can lead a Lying Game prank with the best of them. She's even repairing my relationship with my adoptive family. The only thing she hasn't done is solve my murder.\n\nThen our birth mother, the woman who abandoned us, showed up in Tucson. Emma hasn't seen Becky in twelve years, but Becky recognizes Emma immediatelyÃ¢â‚¬â€as Emma. Is it a mother's intuition . . . or does Becky know I'm already gone?\n\nFrom Sara Shepard, the #1 New York Times bestselling author of the Pretty Little Liars books, comes a riveting series about secrets, lies, and killer consequences.\n\n\nIn .mobi and .epub","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f71d3d0baf3e58e55db6008e6b593ef189e28e93","amp;dn":"Sara+Shepard+-+Cross+My+Heart%2C+Hope+to+Die+-+Lying+Game+book+5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f71d3d0baf3e58e55db6008e6b593ef189e28e93","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,29,61,11,175,62,88,229,93,182,0,142,107,89,62,241,137,226,142,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
