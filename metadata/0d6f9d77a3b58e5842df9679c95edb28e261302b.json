One such record was issued each year from 1963 to 1969\n\nConceived as a means to appease fan-club members whose letters, due to their sheer volume, were not always being answered in a timely manner, the records included the Beatles' messages of thanks to &quot;loyal Beatle people&quot;, along with skits, Christmas carols, and original compositions.\n\n1964: Another Beatles Christmas Record [320k MP3]\n\n    Recorded: 26 October 1964\n    Location: Dick James Music\n    Writer: Tony Barrow\n    Producer: Tony Barrow\n    Issued: 18 December 1964\n    Label: Lyntone, LYN 757\n    Flexi disc: 7&quot;, 1 side, 45 RPM\n    Total time: 3:58\n\nThe song &quot;Jingle Bells&quot; is sung, followed by individual messages to the fans. John mocks the prepared statement, doing an imitation of Paul Harvey and includes his own pseudo-words and ad-libbing. When Paul asks him if he wrote this himself, he says, &quot;No it's somebody's bad hand-wroter. It's been a busy year Beople peadles, one way and another, but it's been a great year too. You fans have seen to that. Page two ... Thanks a lot folks and a happy-er Christmas and a Merry Grew Year. Crimble maybe.&quot; (The statement is apparently handwritten as at various points in the recording, Paul reads &quot;making them&quot; as &quot;melting them&quot; before correcting himself and George reads &quot;quite a time&quot; as &quot;quiet time&quot; before correcting himself with &quot;great time&quot; as well.) Finishing up the record is a brief rendition of the traditional song &quot;Oh Can You Wash Your Father's Shirt?&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d6f9d77a3b58e5842df9679c95edb28e261302b","amp;dn":"The+Beatles+-+Another+Beatles+Christmas+Record+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d6f9d77a3b58e5842df9679c95edb28e261302b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,111,157,119,163,181,142,88,66,223,150,121,201,94,219,40,226,97,48,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
