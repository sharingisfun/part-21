The slaying of Thomas and Martha Wayne is the torturous point on which Bruce turns to become Batman.\n\nThe Dark Knight's file on the case has long been closed, the foundations of Bruce Wayne's secret life secure in the simple genesis of a mugging gone horribly wrong.\n\nThese foundations are shaken, however, when an unexpected guest invades the grounds of Wayne Manor, raising questions about the event that ended the lives of the mother he loved and the father he worshipped, and sparked his unquenchable drive to protect and avenge.\n\nTo discover his real family history, Batman must face down old foes, his only confidant, and the evil heart of Arkham Asylum, and shoulder the new burden of a dark legacy.\n\n\n                           Format 1 - Epub\n\n                           Format 2 - Mobi\n\n\n         **Support Your Favorite Authors By Buying Their Books**","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1425f39501da383ddd05e1b90a5bdd29d5e5da5f","amp;dn":"Wayne+of+Gotham+by+Tracy+Hickman","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1425f39501da383ddd05e1b90a5bdd29d5e5da5f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,37,243,149,1,218,56,61,221,5,225,185,10,91,221,41,213,229,218,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
