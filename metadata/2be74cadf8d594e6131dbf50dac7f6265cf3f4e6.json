For All the Tea in China is the remarkable account of Fortune's journeys into ChinaÃ¢â‚¬â€a thrilling narrative that combines history, geography, botany, natural science, and old-fashioned adventure.\n\nDisguised in Mandarin robes, Fortune ventured deep into the country, confronting pirates, hostile climate, and his own untrustworthy men as he made his way to the epicenter of tea production, the remote Wu Yi Shan hills. One of the most daring acts of corporate espionage in history, Fortune's pursuit of China's ancient secret makes for a classic nineteenth-century adventure tale, one in which the fate of empires hinges on the feats of one extraordinary man.\n\nAdrian Higgins\nWith her probing inquiry and engaging prose, Sarah Rose paints a fresh and vivid account of life in rural 19th-century China and Fortune's fateful journey into itÃ¢â‚¬Â¦if ever there was a book to read in the company of a nice cuppa, this is it.\nÃ¢â‚¬â€The Washington Post\n\nProduct Details\nISBN-13: 9780143118749\nPublisher: Penguin Group (USA) Incorporated\nPublication date: 2/22/2011\n\nMeet the Author\nSarah Rose holds degrees from Harvard University and the University of Chicago.
