Gravity and Phi were together.  The others were seperate.  Mania was a single FLAC paired with a CUE.  I split the tracks using CUETools.\nProperly repackaged, renamed, re-tagged, and sorted.\n\nSounds excellent played at high volumes through large, good speakers.  \nI had to include the Fuzzsplit.  Some of those tracks are just amazing.  Listen to New Woman.  It is an ass puncher for sure.\n\nIf you enjoy, please buy their merch and go to a show.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ca980ae2e535dfc3bee43343d78bdae70864710","amp;dn":"Truckfighters+Discography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ca980ae2e535dfc3bee43343d78bdae70864710","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,169,128,174,46,83,93,252,59,238,67,52,61,120,189,174,112,134,71,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
