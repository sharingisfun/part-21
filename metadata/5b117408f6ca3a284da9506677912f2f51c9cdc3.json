He gets a call from a neighbor in his hometown, Lewiston, telling him that his mother has been taken to the hospital after having a stroke. Lacking a functioning car, Parker decides to hitchhike the 120-miles south to visit his mother.\nHis first ride is with an old man who continually tugs at his crotch in a car that stinks of urine. Happy to escape this ride, Alan starts walking, thumbing his next ride. Coming upon a graveyard, Alan notices a headstone for a stranger named George Staub (Staub is German and means dust): &quot;Well Begun, Too Soon Done.&quot; Sure enough, the next car to pick him up is George Staub, complete with black stitches around his neck where his head had been sewn on after being severed and wearing a button saying &quot;I rode The Bullet at Thrill Village, Laconia.&quot;\nDuring the ride, George talks to Alan about the amusement park ride he was too scared to ride as a kid: The Bullet in Thrill Village, Laconia, New Hampshire. George tells Alan that before they reach the lights of town, Alan must choose who goes on the death ride with George: Alan or his mother. In a moment of fright, Alan saves himself and tells him to &quot;Take her. Take my Mother.&quot;\nGeorge shoves Alan out of the car, where he reappears alone at the graveyard, wearing the &quot;I Rode the Bullet at Thrill Village&quot; button. Alan eventually reaches the hospital, despite his guilt and the impending feeling that his mother is dead or will die any moment, his mother is fine.\nAlan takes the button and treasures it as a good (or bad) luck charm, his mother returns to work and to smoking, he graduates and takes care of his mother for several years and another stroke.\nOne day he loses the button and knows what the phone call was about.... He finds the button underneath his mother's bed, and after a final moment of sadness, guilt, and meditation, decides to carry on.\n\nFun is fun'n done is done,... Nobody lives forever, but we all shine on.\n\nSee_Me_Torrents'n_Seed _Me_Torrents. \n\nEnjoy !","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b117408f6ca3a284da9506677912f2f51c9cdc3","amp;dn":"Riding+the+Bullet+2004.480i.DVDRip.H.263.DivX+.+NVEE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b117408f6ca3a284da9506677912f2f51c9cdc3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,17,116,8,246,202,58,40,77,169,80,102,119,145,47,47,81,201,205,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
