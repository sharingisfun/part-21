Rory's Radio (03:39)\n\nWithin the United States the soaring cacophony of Rock, Rap and Hip-Hop may often prove to be the most rampant of movements among media concentration. When we think of Country and Western music, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mighty hard to conjure imagery exempt of Dolly Parton, craggy dungareesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and then naturally, our innocuously slow friend, Cletus from The Simpsons. However, a fine young lady-resident of Coffeeville, Alabama gives the genre an all too needed kick up the ass... Quite literally!\n\nAshton Shepherd, this 24 year old package of fiery splendour, has communicated that exact spirit of revival through her newly released second album, Ã¢â‚¬ËœWhere Country GrowsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. She is seen to chisel sassy expression through a collection of amusingly garish songs thusly propelling her as a true veteran of the quintessential western sound.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“...deftly sculpting words and phrases like a seasoned master...Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ - Randy Lewis, The L.A. Times\n\nHer worn-in rustic voice is instantly engaging, joyful, hopeful, yet also somewhat intimidating and tough-minded... What a parcel! This album is a flourishing transition from her debut, Ã¢â‚¬ËœSounds So GoodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, which in 2008 ascertained huge reception among the Ã¢â‚¬ËœDollywoodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Country and Western faithful. However, Ã¢â‚¬ËœWhere Country GrowsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ has definitely received a mixed bag of responses; with Kevin John Coyne of Country Universe rather scientifically slapping it with a C rating. He labelled the assemblage as &quot;outdated&quot;. \n\nHe also expounded that even as, &quot;Ashton Shepherd is bringing country back to country... a dull vocal isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t improved by exaggerated twang. It just sounds forced.&quot;\n\nI would champion that her latest episode is considerably better than the former. Illustrative of such fanciful progression comes in the form of Ã¢â‚¬ËœLook It Up.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ This jocular yet essentially empowering number is by far my favourite of the lot; with its regrettably catchy pulse and frolicsome rhythm. And if you were thinking you were all good, you are then opportunely bestowed with Ã¢â‚¬ËœIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m GoodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, which augments the playful quality earlier. And the title track, Ã¢â‚¬ËœMore Cows Than PeopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, yes a rootinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ tootin fact of South Dakota, but more pertinently, is a fine humdinger worthy of toe tap or two.\n\nI feel compelled to declare that I am writing this item whilst an episode of Ã¢â‚¬ËœOnly Fool and HorsesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ reverberates harmlessly in the background. And it got me all pensive... Del Boy and Dolly Parton are really one in the same - Why? You intuitive brutes rightly enquire. Well allow me to elucidate. In short, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re timeless characters and are both indeed manifestations of societyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s prevailing expression. Par exemple Ã¢â‚¬ËœOnly Fools...Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ proved so ingeniously comical, that the show became a national institution. By the same token, Dolly and her Country and Western compatriots, were so tremendously ingrained within American society, it never ceases to lose its appeal, even today...\n\nThrough ShepherdÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s grounded vocal and vivacious charm an air of familiarity and accessibility, evoking huge collectivism, is accordingly unearthed. In no way am I saying the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a pioneering stride in musical venture, my tastes are pretty conflicting, however; her balanced commercial nous would probably keep her afloat on a tepid country wave for some time IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d imagine. There is room for this expressionist, and that room is firmly placed in the deep south of America... Alabama, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all yours!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc7b11f3f443f61fced9c4b5aca51ee98d4dff10","amp;dn":"Ashton+Shepherd+-+where+country+grows+%5B2011%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc7b11f3f443f61fced9c4b5aca51ee98d4dff10","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,123,17,243,244,67,246,31,206,217,196,181,172,165,30,233,141,77,255,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
