Buck-toothed and cursed by shyness, Ripley turned \nhis sense of being an outsider into an appreciation for the strangeness of the world. After selling his first cartoon to Time magazine at age eighteen, more cartooning triumphs followed, but it was his Ã¢â‚¬Å“Believe It or NotÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ conceit and the wildly popular radio shows it birthed that would make him one of the most successful entertainment figures of his time and spur him to search the globeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s farthest corners for bizarre facts, exotic human curiosities, and shocking phenomena.\nRipley delighted in making outrageous declarations that somehow always turned out to be trueÃ¢â‚¬â€such as that Charles Lindbergh was only the sixty-seventh man to fly across the Atlantic or that Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Star Spangled BannerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ was not the national anthem. Assisted by an exotic harem of female admirers and by ex-banker Norbert Pearlroth, a devoted researcher who spoke eleven languages, Ripley simultaneously embodied the spirit of Peter Pan, the fearlessness of Marco Polo and the marketing savvy of P. T. Barnum.\nBy the 1930s Ripley possessed a vast fortune, a private yacht, and a twenty-eight room mansion stocked with such Ã¢â‚¬Å“odditiesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ as shrunken heads and medieval torture devices, and his pioneering firsts in print, radio, and television were tapping into something deep in the American consciousnessÃ¢â‚¬â€a taste for the titillating and exotic, and a fascination with the fastest, biggest, dumbest and most weird. Today, that legacy continues and can be seen in reality TV, YouTube, AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s \nFunniest Home Videos, Jackass, MythBusters and a host of other pop-culture phenomena.\nIn the end Robert L. Ripley changed everything. The supreme irony of his life, which was dedicated to exalting the strange and unusual, is that he may have been the \n\nmost amazing oddity of all.\n\nAbout the Author &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/ciu/fc/3a/483dc0a398a08942afecf110.L._V249528597_.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/ciu/fc/3a/483dc0a398a08942afecf110.L._V249528597_.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\nNeal specializes in narrative nonfiction, biography, and overlooked Americana.
