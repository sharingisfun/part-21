This form of corporal punishment has nothing to do with Islamic law. Under international law, judicial corporal punishment such as caning constitutes torture or other ill-treatment, which are absolutely prohibited in all circumstances. As a member of the Association of Southeast Asia Nations (ASEAN), Malaysia should consider the regional consequences of caning migrants and refugees. To comply with international law, the Malaysian government must abolish judicial caning altogether.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/eAnemaAei&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/eAnemaAei&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:797b6c186112dc92bc74b6be2c5b56fd48aeb634","amp;dn":"A+Blow+to+Humanity+-+Torture+by+Judicial+Caning+in+Malaysia+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"797b6c186112dc92bc74b6be2c5b56fd48aeb634","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,123,108,24,97,18,220,146,188,116,182,190,44,91,86,253,72,174,182,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
