CJSS played real songs that featured power vocals, guitar mastery, intense drums and pounding bass. In 1986 CJSS released 2 acclaimed albums: &quot;World Gone Mad&quot; and &quot;Praise The Loud.&quot; This demo includes some of the fans' favorite tracks that didn't make the first 2 releases due to time constraints of the vinyl Lp. (You could only put a limited amount of time on a album! 22 or so minutes a side.) While sonically not major label quality, the audio is remarkably &quot;live&quot; with few overdubs. This only solidifies the fact that CJSS had what it took to deliver an amazing concert. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a90e2470925c4d769c6676795d255381f203fe0","amp;dn":"CJSS+The+7+Hills+Demo+320+CD+Rip+-+David+Chastain+Metal","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a90e2470925c4d769c6676795d255381f203fe0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,144,226,71,9,37,196,215,105,198,103,103,149,210,85,56,31,32,63,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
