And sometimes he transgresses genre limits and teams up with Massimo Pupillo and Lasse Marhaug on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Your NextÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ or with James Plotkin, who is better known as a pioneer guitarist in new metal, dark ambient, industrial, noise, grindcore and drone rock Ã¢â‚¬â€œ heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s worked with bands  like OLD, Scorn, Khanate, Phantomsmasher, Khlyst and his latest project Jodis.\n\nGrindcore guitar can also be subsumed under Ã¢â‚¬Å“noiseÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (see this weekÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s reviews) so that Nilssen-LoveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s decision to work with Plotkin is no great surprise. More interesting is PlotkinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s approach to Nilssen-LoveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ferocious off-the-wall style: solid beats and sound textures instead of trying to compete with drums gone wild. A reversal of the classic role of drums and guitar. Even the melodies Plotkin throws in belong to that strategy. Both musicians seem to profit from this approach, all the tracks are very intense, aggressive and challenging.\n\nThe album starts in a spectacular way: The first track, Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Skin, the ColourÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ opens with PlotkinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s\nopen chords reminiscent of classic American post rock bands like Tortoise and Trans Am. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the best track on the album, a constant clash of musical ideas, in which the musicians frequently change sides. Plotkin uses a lot of synthesizer sounds instead of normal guitar, and almost demolishes the track Ã¢â‚¬â€œ which Nilssen-Love does nothing to prevent Ã¢â‚¬â€œ resulting in some brilliantly eccentric moments. Unfortunately, the album cannot maintain this level. Although the other tracks are good they do not have the same focus as Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Skin, the ColourÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, the sounds and structure are mostly variants of the opening track.\n\nNevertheless, this is an interesting album, especially in the context of the recent collaborations with Lasse Marhaug. Again, it shows another side of Paal Nilssen-Love, such as when he\nexcels on cymbals in Ã¢â‚¬Å“PrimateriaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, a pure prog rock fantasy that sounds like a manic acid trip.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8aa2d8877a18efbdad75c4a5839e9afc767e23b","amp;dn":"James+Plotkin+%26amp%3B+Paal+Nilssen-Love+-+Death+Rattle+%282013%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8aa2d8877a18efbdad75c4a5839e9afc767e23b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,170,45,136,119,161,142,251,218,215,92,74,88,57,233,175,199,103,226,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
