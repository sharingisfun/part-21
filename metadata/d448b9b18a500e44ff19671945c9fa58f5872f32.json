When the group rescues a dog caged for medical testing on a nearby island, they are exposed to an experimental strain of canine parvovirus that changes their lives forever.\nAs the friends discover their heightened senses and animal-quick reflexes, they must combine their scientific curiosity with their newfound physical gifts to solve a cold-case murder that has suddenly become very hot--if they can stay alive long enough to catch the killer's scent.\n\nFortunately, they are now more than friends--they're a pack. They are Virals.\n\n\n                          Format 1 - Epub\n\n\n                          Format 2 - Mobi\n\n\n\n         **Support Your Favorite Authors By Buying Their Books**","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d448b9b18a500e44ff19671945c9fa58f5872f32","amp;dn":"Virals+by+Kathy+Reichs+%28Virals+trilogy+Book+1%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d448b9b18a500e44ff19671945c9fa58f5872f32","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,72,185,177,138,80,14,68,255,25,103,25,69,201,250,88,245,135,47,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
