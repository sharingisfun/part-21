ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a task in which Stone has a personal stake, and one that is made all the more pleasurableÃ¢â‚¬â€though somewhat more complicatedÃ¢â‚¬â€with the arrivals of two beautiful women with whom heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s intimately acquainted.\n\nBut the grand occasion has also attracted a dangerous criminal group with sinister plans. The hunt to find them leads Stone into a complex web of deceit and misdirection, in a world where the intrigues of government intelligence collide with the clandestine machinations of the upper crust. As he draws nearer to his quarry, he realizes that the stakes are higher than anybody could ever imagine . . . and that the enemies heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s seeking might just be hiding in plain sight.\n\nFormats provided are:\n.ePub -\nCompatible with most eReaders including the Apple iPad.
