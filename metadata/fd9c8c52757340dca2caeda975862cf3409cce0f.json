This tale is highly disturbing and not for the squeamish.\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd9c8c52757340dca2caeda975862cf3409cce0f","amp;dn":"The+Edgar+Allan+Poe+Collection+++%28Vol.+1%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd9c8c52757340dca2caeda975862cf3409cce0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,156,140,82,117,115,64,220,162,202,237,169,117,134,44,243,64,156,206,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
