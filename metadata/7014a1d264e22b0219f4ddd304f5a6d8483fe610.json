And now he must help a group of supernatural villainsÃ¢â‚¬â€led by one of HarryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most dreaded and despised enemies, Nicodemus ArchleoneÃ¢â‚¬â€to break into the highest-security vault in town, so that they can then access the highest-security vault in the Nevernever. \n\nIt's a smash and grab job to recover the literal Holy Grail from the vaults of the greatest treasure hoard in the supernatural worldÃ¢â‚¬â€which belongs to the one and only Hades, Lord of the freaking Underworld and generally unpleasant character. Worse, Dresden suspects that there is another game afoot that no one is talking about. And he's dead certain that Nicodemus has no intention of allowing any of his crew to survive the experience. Especially Harry.\n\nDresden's always been tricky, but he's going to have to up his backstabbing game to survive this messÃ¢â‚¬â€assuming his own allies donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t end up killing him before his enemies get the chanceÃ¢â‚¬Â¦","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7014a1d264e22b0219f4ddd304f5a6d8483fe610","amp;dn":"Jim+Butcher+-+Skin+Game","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7014a1d264e22b0219f4ddd304f5a6d8483fe610","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,20,161,210,100,226,43,2,25,244,221,211,4,245,166,216,72,63,230,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
