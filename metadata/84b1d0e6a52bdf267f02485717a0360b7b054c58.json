After many years he lights upon the wreck of the civilisationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most powerful starship: the Resurrection.\nSorran ignores the dangers and orders his crew to dock. The explorers and Sorran himself will face the mysteries of the Resurrection and the secret of the origins of the dark side.\n\nUploaders Note: This is essentially a cinema level high caliber fan project, with real actors for a series that really hasn't been given enough screen time. \nGeorge Lucas's movies where great, but the universe is so much bigger than 6 movies can possibly explore. Up until know fans have been content with expanded universe novels &amp; it's offspring: wookiepedia. That is starting to change.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:84b1d0e6a52bdf267f02485717a0360b7b054c58","amp;dn":"Star+Wars+Dark+Resurrection+Vol.0+%282011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"84b1d0e6a52bdf267f02485717a0360b7b054c58","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,177,208,230,165,43,223,38,127,2,72,87,23,160,54,11,123,5,76,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
