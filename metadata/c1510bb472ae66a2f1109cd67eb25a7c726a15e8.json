Forever Changing begins in the early-Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ60s when a new flock of folk music troubadours and vagabonds nested in coffeehouses and festivals.\n\nThe label changed with the times, stretching in different directions and experimenting with artists and music that were wholly un-commercial. The good, bad, strange, and sublime are all present and accounted for across these five discs. \n(Christian John Wikane, popmatters.com)\n\n- - -\n\nVA - Forever Changing- Golden Age of Elektra 1963-1973\n(5CD Rhino 2007\n\n 1.
