This torrent contains the bin file, so it should work on the PSX emulator. Not sure if it could be burned, but then I am no tech expert.\n\nI have taken it upon myself to preserve and spread the joy of this increasingly rare game. I am currently working on getting a hold of the sequel, Panzer Front Ausf.b for PS2, which was a Europe/Japan only release.\n\nPlease enjoy this tank simulator and seed. If it doesn't work then post a comment please and I will try to fix it with my limited knowledge of computers.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7328b2ca63a3b4d6d605426dbf73dab7cd2dd22","amp;dn":"Panzer+Front+%5Beng%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7328b2ca63a3b4d6d605426dbf73dab7cd2dd22","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,50,139,44,166,58,59,77,109,96,84,38,219,247,61,171,124,210,221,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
