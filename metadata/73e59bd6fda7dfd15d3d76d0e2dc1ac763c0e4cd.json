This guide is a must for anyone who wants to join the growing ranks of 21st Century backyard radio astronomers. The first part of the book provides background material and explains (in a non-mathematical way) our present knowledge of the stronger radio sources Ã¢â‚¬â€œ those observable by amateurs Ã¢â‚¬â€œ including the Sun, Jupiter, Meteors, Galactic and extra-galactic sources. The second part of the book deals not only with observing, but Ã¢â‚¬â€œ assuming no prior technical knowledge of electronics or radio theory Ã¢â‚¬â€œ takes the reader step-by-step through the process of building and using a backyard radio telescope. There are complete, detailed plans and construction information for a number of amateur radio telescopes, the simplest of which can be put together and working Ã¢â‚¬â€œ using only simple tools Ã¢â‚¬â€œ in a weekend. For other instruments, there are full details of circuit-board layouts, components to use and (vitally important in radio astronomy) how to construct antennae for radio astronomy.\n\n\nTitle: The Radio Sky and How to Observe It\nAuthor: Jeff Lashley\nPublisher: Springer\nYear: 2010\nFormat: PDF\n\nMore INFO on the book below:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/144190882X/ref=olp_product_details?ie=UTF8&amp;me=&amp;seller=&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/144190882X/ref=olp_product_details?ie=UTF8&amp;me=&amp;seller=&lt;/a&gt;\n\nCheck out the new PirateWiki!
