When you place the hash code (copy hash code from any torrent site as most torrent sites provide the hash info and then you paste the code into the box where it says &quot;Place Torrent Hash Here&quot; you then can add Trackers (Optional) but because torrents are tracked by a central DHT you don't need to) and then select &quot;Get Torrent&quot; and uTorrent or compatible client will appear and then press &quot;O.K.&quot; \n\nAlso available thegoodforum.com for another way of downloading.  \n\nPlease SEED for others to Enjoy! \nCheers, Bubanee ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ede2f317002fa4654e027251043ab25b08b5705","amp;dn":"Standalone+Desktop+Hash+Grabber+%5BBubanee%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ede2f317002fa4654e027251043ab25b08b5705","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,222,47,49,112,2,250,70,84,224,39,37,16,67,171,37,176,139,87,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
