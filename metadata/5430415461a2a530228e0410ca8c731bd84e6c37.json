This is the first new recording from the great alto saxist Jemeel\nMoondoc in more than five years and it is a welcome return to the fold. The\nonly sad thing about this disc is that it is last (or perhaps next to last)\nrecording from Downtown trumpet great Roy Campbell, Jr. who passed away in\nJanuary of this year (2014) and to whom this disc is dedicated.\n\nThis is a studio date and man, does it sound great! Aside from Moondoc and the\nrhythm team, each of the other frontline folks (Shipp, Campbell &amp; Swell) are on\ntwo pieces each. The title track is first and it has a suspenseful, dreamy vibe\nwith a sweeping undercurrent warm waves from Mr. Shipp. This is the first time\nthat Mr. Moondoc and Mr. Shipp have recorded together so the interplay between\nthem is fascinating as they weave several lines together at the same\ntime. &quot;Little Blue Elvira&quot; has a fine, bluesy theme with inspired solos from\nboth brass players and Moondoc as well. The one cover here is Alice Coltrane's\n&quot;Ptah, the El Daoud&quot;, the title track from her album from 1970. Like much of\nMs. Coltrane's music from this period, the music has a spiritual vibe which is\nwell captured here also. The buoyant rhythm team sounds especially inspired\nwith superb solos from Mr. Swell and Mr. Campbell. Mr. Moondoc's distinctive\ntone and rich playing is featured on &quot;One for Monk &amp; Trane&quot; which includes a\nfine yet more inside solo from Mr. Shipp, showing a side to Shipp that we\nrarely see/hear. The last song is a poignant ballad for just Jemeel and the\nrhythm section and it is somber and haunting. An exquisite way to end one truly\nfine disc from Downtown legend Jemeel Moondoc and his well chosen crew.\n\n--\n\nBy Tom Burris &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.freejazzblog.org/2014/07/jemeel-moondoc-zookeepers-house.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.freejazzblog.org/2014/07/jemeel-moondoc-zookeepers-house.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBest Jazz Of 2014: 5-1\nWritten by burning ambulance &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://burningambulance.com/2014/12/05/2014-best-jazz-5/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://burningambulance.com/2014/12/05/2014-best-jazz-5/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5430415461a2a530228e0410ca8c731bd84e6c37","amp;dn":"Jemeel+Moondoc+-+The+Zookeeper%27s+House+%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5430415461a2a530228e0410ca8c731bd84e6c37","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,48,65,84,97,162,165,48,34,142,4,16,202,140,115,27,216,78,108,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
