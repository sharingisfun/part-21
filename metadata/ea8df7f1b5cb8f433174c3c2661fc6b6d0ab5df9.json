It can be used for anything from\ncreating 3D characters for video games and movies to\nquickly exploring 3D architectural ideas.\n\nSilo is currently being used at top studios worldwide as\nboth a stand-alone design tool and as a versatile element\nof a multi-software 3D graphics workflow.\n\nPure, Focused 3D Modeling\n\nSilo brings 3D modeling zen to artists via a clean,\nfocused environment and a streamlined toolset, honed over\nyears of development. It was initially born of our own\nfrustration with the needless complexity and slow,\nunmanageable workflows of all-in-one graphics software.\nWe single-mindedly devoted Silo to modeling, discovering\nthat the modeling workflow could be made much simpler\nwithout sacrificing any power. This unique approach has\nattracted in equal number students, hobbyists, and\nprofessional artists in film, games, architecture, and\nother fields looking to maximize their production. (Read\ninterviews with professional artists using Silo.)\n\nAt Silo's heart is an innovative, robust, and 100%\ncustomizable polygon editing toolset, suitable to both\norganic and hard-surface modeling. This polygonal base\nmesh is used to drive subdivision surfaces if desired:\njust hit C and V to navigate between subdivision levels\nand the base mesh at any time. Those coming to Silo from\nother applications will find that, despite having fewer\ntools, Silo isn't lacking any functionality. Instead,\nbasic modeling tools such as Tweak, Cut, Bevel, Extrude,\nand Slide intelligently adapt to the task at hand based\non context, drastically cutting down on the time spent\nswitching or hunting for tools. (Watch\ncontext-sensitivity in action with the Cut Tool.)\n\nOn top of this core toolset we've added non-destructive\nbrush-based displacement painting (especially useful for\nhigh res meshes or directly editing subdivision layers),\nadvanced uv unwrapping, and the unique Topology Brush\nwhich lets you literally draw a new edge flow onto a 3D\nsurface. Intuitive, advanced selection tools including\nTweak, Loop, Ring, Path, Grow/Shrink, and Soft Selection\nare key to a fast, fluid workflow. (Watch how Tweak lets\nyou instantly grab and adjust points, edges, and faces to\norganically reshape the model.)\n\nFinally, we've priced Silo to be accessible to everyone.\nWe strongly believe that inexpensive 3d modeling need not\nsacrifice any quality, and we've designed Silo to prove\nit.\n\nINSTALLATION NOTES:\n\n1. Unzip, unrar and install the program.\n2. Replace the original file(s) with those in crack.zip\n3.
